   - Example: "国内做老板太难了！辛苦的亏损还不如直接躺平"

### Content That Fits Within Categories:

## Recommendation: ✅ Keep the 3 Categories

The 3 categories are **appropriate and well-defined**:

1. **Investment (价值投资)** - Stock analysis, valuation, market trends
2. **Life Philosophy (人生智慧)** - Personal development, values, life wisdom
3. **Entrepreneurship (创业经营)** - Business management, entrepreneurship, operations

### Why These Categories Work:

1. **Clear Primary Focus**: Each category has a distinct primary focus
2. **Natural Overlap**: The mixed categories (8.7%) represent natural intersections
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Together they cover 91.9% of content
4. **Practical Organization**: Easy to navigate and find relevant content

### Suggested Organization:

- **Primary filing**: File under the category with highest score
- **Tagging system**: Add secondary tags for mixed content
- **Search capability**: Allow searching across categories

### Minor Notes:

- The 3 uncategorized videos (0.6%) are truly miscellaneous (e.g., "散步遇到郊狼", "美国有没有预制菜")
- These can remain uncategorized or be tagged as "Miscellaneous"
- The categorization algorithm works well - only 0.6% truly unclassifiable

---

## Conclusion

**The 3 categories are good and appropriate.** They accurately reflect the channel's content structure:
- Investment is the primary focus (47.3%)
- Life Philosophy provides the foundation (23.3%)
- Entrepreneurship bridges investment with practical business (17.3%)

The overlap categories (8.7%) are natural and expected, representing content that spans multiple domains. This is actually a strength - it shows the interconnectedness of investment, business, and life wisdom.
