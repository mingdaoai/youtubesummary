Today's episode is the bootstrappers
guide to getting customers with Google
ads, with Facebook ads, with Perplexity,
with Hey Gen, with 11 Labs, and more. It
is easy to vibe code an app. You've done
it. I've done it. But it is so hard to
actually get customers. Now, there
doesn't exist tutorials on YouTube that
give the actual sauce with how to do it.
And today with Cody Schneider, we just
show you how to do it step by step. How
to get your customers, how to run paid
ads. What does that look like? No
gatekeeping, all the sauce. And if you
stick to the end of the episode, I think
that you're going to be a better
founder, a better entrepreneur. And
these types of episodes, people, they
charge 5, 10, 15, $25,000 for it. This
is absolutely free. I hope this gets
your creative juices flowing and I hope
that you build a big business with some
of these ideas.
[Music]
>> Cody Schneider on the pod. We're going
to talk about how to grow your vibe
coded startup. You you built something.
You vibecoded something, but you need
customers. And no one's talking about
this and no one is explaining to you in
a simple way how to actually do it with
the alpha. Um, so I brought in Cody
Schneider and Cody, by the end of the
episode, what are people going to learn?
I'm going to give you a step-by-step
playbook and like the strategy and the
actual tactics and I'll try to show as
literally as much as I can for like each
of the things whether it's paid ads or
cold DMs like all the automation tools
I'm using so that in the next 24 hours
you can have some type of marketing
channel live to start promoting this
thing and everything I'm going to teach
you layers together right so like it all
creates this symbiotic relationship that
creates like this growth flywheel for
you
>> let's go all right cool so Let's Let's
get into it. I know. And you're going to
give all the tools, all the talk, all
the sauce. I need you to promise me.
>> I promise you. I'll show you everything.
>> Okay, cool. All right. So, you can start
sharing your screen and we'll get into
it.
>> Sweet. Okay, cool. So, first off, um
let's talk through uh paid ads and what
like for most like especially if you're
building an SMB product like a a B2B
SAS, but you're like servicing SMBs and
and maybe we should come up with a
product that we're trying to sell. Uh,
Greg. Um, this is actually one we're
building right now. So, I can just use
that and I'll share all the the details
because I don't care. Um, but, uh, it's
basically a YouTube uh, channel uh,
email scraper.
And this is a uh, like perfect type of
product that you'd want to go build. Um,
let me do uh, YouTube channel email
extractor. That's actually what it is.
By the way, I noticed I noticed you have
what is that Chrome extension that
you're using that shows the
>> Yeah, it's called Keywords Everywhere.
They should they owe me so much money
for like showing this. I don't know why
it doesn't want to open right now, but
basically it's just a browser extension
that modifies Google so that you can see
uh the total volume uh the total CP or
the average CPC, the competition. Um and
then also like this is what I use for
all those trend graphs that I post. It
basically like shows you the search
volume over time for this graph. So like
this one, there's like not good data, so
it's doesn't really show anything. Um,
but uh this is it. It's a great way to
do quick validation research. And for
anything that you're building, this is
actually where I would start before I
would even build a product is like I
would try to figure out like the
marketing and the go to market motion
before I even, you know, build anything
because if you can't validate that
people actually want to buy this, like
you shouldn't build it. And I think this
is like a mistake I see a lot of
first-time founders or builders create
or like you know they always what they
do is they build product and they try to
figure out marketing and it should be
the opposite. It should be like validate
people want to buy this thing see if you
can build it and then figure out how to
sell it right. Um at its core like when
you look at a business you know when
it's in its simplest form it's basically
having something that people want to buy
and being able to sell it to them. Like
that is a business at its core. And so I
I think that one of the easiest ways to
actually validate that this is something
that people want to buy is you have to
you can just look at like keywords and
the keyword volume like are people
actually searching for this? Can I find
like Reddit threads that this is a
problem for? Like I would do also this
like YouTube channel uh email extractor
Reddit and like see if there's
conversations around this. It's like
literally top result, bro. Like [ __ ]
request for SAS YouTube email scraper.
Couldn't make that up. You couldn't make
that any better, right? Um so anyways,
once I found that, um I would be like,
"Okay, cool." Like now I'm going to go
build a product around this. How would I
actually market this? Um so I'm going to
talk through Google Ads first and the
actual like setup process. I don't know
how much I can show. I mean, I could
probably show um I guess we could make
up like a separate account and like show
you I'll just show you the the kind of
the the structure that I think that we
could do. I actually I'm not sure on
this G. So, I'll just kind of play I'll
play I'll play jazz on it. Um but so
anyways, what uh I would then do is I'd
be like, "Okay, cool. I'm going to try
to set up a campaign." The challenge
with this is that like you you couldn't
bid on the keyword phrase YouTube. So,
what you'd have to do is be like channel
email extractor, right? And like that
would be the ad that you actually end up
running. And uh the uh keyword you would
bid on is YouTube channel email
extractor, but you would have to like
basically run an ad to uh the the ad
that you're like the the ad creative
that's in there. It would have to be um
uh uh like only say channel email
scraper. And the reason for that is
because like they'll flag this. let's
actually just like I can just grow and
set up an account. Um
>> Sam Alman, the co-founder of OpenAI just
said that it is the era of the idea guy
and he is not wrong. I think that right
now is an incredible time to be building
a startup and if you listen to this
podcast, chances are you think so too.
Now I think that you can look at trends
uh to basically figure out uh what are
the startup ideas you should be
building. So that's exactly why I built
ideabser.com. every single day you're
going to get a free startup idea in your
inbox and it's all backed by high
quality data trends. How we do it?
People always ask. We use AI agents to
go and search what are people looking
for and what are they screaming for in
terms of products that you should be
building and then we hand it on a you
know silver platter for you to go check
out. Um we do have a few paid plans that
you know take it to the next level. uh
give you more ideas, give you more AI
agents and more almost like a chatgbt
for ideas with it, but you can start for
free ideabser.com. And if you're
listening to this, I highly recommend
it.
>> Okay, cool. So, this is uh like a Google
Ads account, and I'm going to show you
like step by step how to actually set up
like the paid ad strategy here. So, um
to begin with, you're going to go do new
campaign. And what I typically do is I
start with a click campaign. And the
reason for that is because I'm just
trying to see the actual keywords that
people are searching. All of these
keyword research tools. They're going to
give you like what they, you know, it's
an estimate, you know, of of what they
think that people are searching based on
the data that they're aggregating from
like all the clickstream data, etc. But
what I actually want to figure out is
the actual search terms that people are
searching from the beginning. So, I'm
going to do website traffic. I'm going
to do search. Another campaign type is
performance max. I'll talk about that in
a second. We're seeing that actually be
really effective right now. So, I can
talk to that in a moment. Um, but then
what I'll do is we'll like throw up a
website. We'll just say like YouTube
scraper, right, as like a placeholder.
Um, and then just to get us to like move
forward.
I'm just going to try to pull
information from this, but it doesn't
exist. So, there won't be anything to do
there. Um, so from here, we're just
going to do page view as the event, and
then I'm going to talk through how to
actually set up events uh in the future
for the actual signup that you're trying
to get to happen. You can set up events
for signup or also a payment conversion.
It's the same exact um uh uh like
technical uh deployment to do both of
those things. But again, I'm focusing on
the on the clicks to begin with. And the
reason for that is again I'm just trying
to understand like the actual like
things that people are searching and
clicking on. It's like a fast way for me
to get uh initial data. I can always
change back to a conversion once I have
the conversion um event set up on my
website. Um but the in the beginning
what you need to do is basically uh just
like get data so you can understand how
people uh like are trying to actually
find this solution. So there's a great
way to actually test a product too like
throw up a landing page in lovable put a
tally form on it. Send some Google ads
traffic to it. I just talked to a
founder who's building an app for like
uh it's like a landing page building
software. Like I was like this is your
literal strategy. Just like bid on this
keyword and see if you can get signups
and like if you can then build the
thing. Um, so like before you even build
the product, right? So anyway, so I'm
going to do clicks and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to target only
the United States and then I'm going to
update for people that are only uh
present in that location. You don't want
to do people that are traveling in that
location. I just see worse results with
that sometimes as well. You can see like
it's this is the the devil in the
details is shown interest in your
location. A lot of people they will get
trapped in like um like you'll see this
where the ads will do really well for
the first like 14 days and then suddenly
they start getting all this cheap
traffic from like the Philippines or
India and they're like I don't even know
how that's happening. We're not even
bidding on it. This is a lot of the
times the reason that that's happening.
So you're trying to have people that are
in that location physically. They're
actually like you know pinging that IP
when they're there. We'll do English. Um
you know none of we don't have to set up
any of the like political ad stuff. Um,
and then from here, we're going to
actually go and set up the uh actual ad.
So, we'll have that be the final um uh
landing page. But then what I would do
is I would go and then start bidding on
those keywords uh that are uh related to
the product that I'm trying to sell. So,
I'm going to talk through this uh in a
second, but what I just did there, so if
I do this keyword like this, that's
technically a broad match keyword. So,
it what would happen is it's probably
going to go and bid on anything that's
email extractor. Whatever the biggest
keyword phrase is that's within this
like longtail phrase, it's going to like
basically level up into that. And I
don't want that to happen. I want it to
only bid on a fan like the family of
keywords that are related uh to the um
uh like to that keyword phrase. So,
YouTube channel email extractor when I
put those quotations around that uh
that's what I is called a phrase match
search. Um, and I I typically start with
phrase match and then I'll go uh either
do a negative keyword uh uh uh
elimination like if I don't want certain
phrases to show up within uh the phrase
match or I will do a uh um I will do an
exact match. Exact match isn't actually
exact match though on Google anymore. Um
it used to be in the past I could be
like anytime somebody searches this
keyword show my ad. They now technically
expand the audience and it's total
[ __ ] I hate it. Um but it's
something that you have to deal with.
Um, and there's ways around it sort of,
but it it they don't actually work. So,
anyways, you have to basically make the
landing page have the language that you
actually want them to convert for. And
then when you do the exact match, like
say you want them to like only, you
know, only show for uh whenever there's
YouTube channel email extractor, you
have to make the landing page have that
as the H1, that would be the only way
that you could kind of like make it
learn down into like only bidding on
that exact match keyword. But anyway, so
I'm going to do that broad match. What
I'm going to go do now too is I'm going
to use keywords everywhere again and I'm
going to go and expand uh find all of
the keywords that people are searching
um that are related to YouTube channel
uh email extractor. So what I'm doing
here is again I just search this and
then I can find all the longtail
keywords. So I'm just going to click
that button and basically what's
happening in the background is it's
going to go and scrape all of the other
keyword phrases that people are
searching along with that the the phrase
that I provided as the source phrase.
Um, we'll see if this wants to actually
work. This app can or this Chrome
extension can be buggy. So, it is is one
of those one of those things. It's
probably a team and like I actually
don't know. I need to meet them at some
point. But, um, anyway, so how to find
YouTube channel by email, email address
extractor. So, what I would be looking
for is like all the ones that are
YouTube. Um, so go down that list. Um,
so like YouTube channel email address
finder, that's a great one, right? So, I
would include that in there as well as a
phrase match and basically add that into
um sorry, let me just actually get this.
I think it's like loading, so it's
technically not actually a static piece
of content. It's like actively moving.
But anyways, I would pull all of these
out. Um let me just stop it and I can
like actually do this for you. All of
these ones that have YouTube, um I would
take these I would pull these out um
that have the search intent that I'm
looking for. So like email extractor for
YouTube channel, that's a great one as
well. Again, I'm putting these in as a
phrase match. And I would just do like
probably 10 of these. That's all you'd
really need to get started. So then at
that point, once you've have the
keywords that you're bidding on, you
would then go and you would actually
have a quick question on that.
>> So if if you go back to keyword uh the
keyword tool, it I noticed like a lot of
the search volume is in the Yeah. 4 30
to 170 couple hundred. Some people are
going to look at that and they're going
to be like, "How is that enough volume?"
>> This is literally like apps that have a
100 search volume a month. I've paid my
rent for the last 10 years. Like I will
never talk about these in public. I will
never share what they are.
The only reason I'm sharing this one cuz
it's like whatever. You know, we're
going to give the sauce away to for free
today because I'm feeling I'm feeling
like uh I'm feeling like Chris Kringle
and I want to I want to I want to be
Santa to you in the middle of summer in
this hot July heat, this hot August
heat. So, the I wouldn't even think
about the search volume. What what I
would think about is like, are there
people that have this pain point that I
can get to pay me $29 a month, $49 a
month, $99 a month? And you know, I
mean, we can just do that math real
quick, right? Like if you have whatever
like say 49 say you have uh 100 people
paying you 49 a month like that ends up
being $4900 right and like this is a
margin business where it's like your
margin is going to be like 95%.
And a lot of the times you don't need
customer service. It's just like set up
a crisp chat, let this thing run in the
background and it's just going to like
it's a little tool. It doesn't really
break. It doesn't it just does this very
small thing. And I think a lot of the
times like this is what I see a lot of
these vibe coders they try to make these
massive platforms. It's like yo take a
step back find one killer feature have
off payment and email for like password
reset like that is your first app that
you should build. If you can't get that
to work you shouldn't level up into like
a platform that has this multi-feature
product scope that's super complicated
and super interactive. It's just it
start with the smallest thing. But
anyway yeah does that answer the
question on that?
>> Absolutely. I was hoping you were gonna
say that.
>> Yeah, man. It's Dude, the riches are in
the niches and like now it's it's easier
than ever to build these and you just
stack them together, right? Like
everybody wants to be Peter Levels, but
nobody actually wants to do what Peter
Levelvels does, which is like [ __ ]
build a hundred different products and
five of them actually make money. And
that's like the game here, right? It's
like you find a bunch of these small
like scraper extractor uh like tools,
right? Like research tools. Dude, there
is so much money in data extraction
tools. It's crazy. Like there's huge
companies that all they do is just like
data extraction from government
documents and like they get absolutely
paid like and nobody wants to like they
just think it's unsexy or like not
interesting but this is what people
actually want. They want this
information. So anyway, okay cool. So
you've got the keywords in there. Um now
you're going to set up the ad. So this
is where I was talking about you won't
be able to have YouTube in the name. So
what you can potentially do is do like
something like YT. I probably I don't
think that would work. I think they
would probably still flag it. Um, you're
not going to be able to have YouTube in
the actual name of the URL that you're
sending to. So, like don't name it this,
name it something else. Um, but what
you'll do is have it be like, uh, I
would probably do something like uh
channel email extractor, right? So, like
still talk to that specific keyword,
email extractor.
And
then the reason for this is I'm trying
to have the the uh uh I'm trying to have
the keyword that I'm bidding on, the ad
that I'm showing, and then the landing
page that I'm sending them to all have
the same keyword phrase um throughout
the whole funnel. And the and the
purpose is because you see a higher
conversion rate when you do this, right?
Um the the strategy here in the
beginning is like I'm just going to bid
on everything. That's why I'm doing
those the click campaign rather than
conversion campaign. And then once I
start to see, okay, cool. Like I'm
seeing a lot of click volume like more
click volume than I thought for email
extractor from YouTube channel than
YouTube channel email extractor. I'm
going to go and build landing pages for
each of these keywords. And when I say a
landing page, like literally all I'm
talking about is like, you know, it's
it's straight up just like the hero
section of your website has that exact
keyword. So like an example of this, I
mean, we could do this in lovable right
now, right? like build a landing page
for this target keyword. Uh
>> I mean it should have the best practices
of a landing page which is for example
uh you probably don't want to have any
navbar. You probably want high cra
contrast. You probably want juicy
buttons you know% all. So
>> look at people need to look at you know
best squeeze pages, best landing pages
and use that as a reference.
>> You want them to do one action. I think
this is the thing that people always get
[ __ ] up on is they're like they're
trying to like get them to watch a demo
and also like download this ebook and
it's like no this person is coming in on
an ad. I want to only show them one
thing that is the most high value thing
that I can get them to do and you don't
know what that is. You don't even know
like is it an ebook? Is it a but it's
one thing that you're trying to get
them. You can get them deeper into the
funnel later on but like just doing that
one thing is going to be the most
effective. And you made a great point
Greg of just like follow best practices.
Like you can literally go to perplexity
and be like what what should the
structure
of this landing page be
uh for this keyword, right? And it's
like here's the keyword and then it's
just going to give you the structure and
you take that over to lovable and you
build that landing page out, right? Like
that's like literally
>> it's so easy.
>> It's so easy. Like this used to take me
again like I I've been doing this 15
years, right? Like this used to take me
weeks, Greg. And now I just did this
live on a video call with you. Like it's
the most insane thing ever. I geek out
about this because it is actually so
crazy. I'm also realizing we're going
probably way like way long on time, too.
So maybe we can do the transactional
today and then we can come back and I'll
do all the like, you know, the the the
part two of this later on. So anyways,
>> um Okay, cool. So you built that landing
page. Uh we'll let that like just vibe
in the background while we move forward
on this. And then what you're going to
do next is set up this conversion event.
So how are you going to do that? You're
going to use Google Tag Manager to set
this up. Google Tag Manager is basically
a container that allows for you to
deploy uh both scripts um which are
scripts and pixels are interchangeable
uh in their in their u in their voice.
Um but then uh what it allows for you to
do as well is you can actually set up uh
events that basically wait they set up a
listener for an event that gets pushed
to the data layer so that you can then
have a trigger so that when that action
happens by the user I can send that
information back to Google ads. And the
reason that you're doing all of this is
you're basically uh trying to say hey
Google you know when people search this
keyword there's a cohort that will
actually make the action that I want
them to do. I want them to do this
action which is a sign up or a payment.
So optimize the ad basically of the
people that are searching that keyword
for the cohort of people that are most
likely to do that action. And it's so
smart that it can actually like train
itself into understanding these people
are most likely to sign up. These people
are most likely to, you know, actually
turn into a paid conversion, etc. Um,
okay. So this is what an actual like
Google Tag Manager account looks like.
This is some random project that I've
been working on that's just in the
background. Right. So, how you actually
set these up um is you're going to go
and create uh so what you'll search on
perplexity is like write um event code
uh for Google tag manager
uh for uh signup conversion.
And so what this is going to do is
basically write the code which is just a
JavaScript code that you want to fire
when the user does the action that
you're looking for. Um so this is like
when they do that form submission. I
want this code to fire and it's going to
send this event to the data layer. And
the data layer is basically just like
this like observable place that like we
can see information. So, it's going to
push this code sign up success
and I can literally go into, you know,
my vibe code and be like add this add
this event for when somebody completes
the form submission and it adds that
there right whatever that end you know
you can it's super easy to implement
this now this used to take again like I
would spend two hours with an engineer
to get this deployed you can now do it
in like minutes um and then once I have
that what I can do is I can set up a uh
event trigger within in Google Tag
Manager that actually allows for me to
observe that uh uh that event firing. So
let me show you what I mean by that. I
can go trigger new and then I will
select uh custom event and then within
custom events I'm going to paste that
signup success and we'll just name that
something like um you know event uh
signup. And then once I've once I've set
that up and I have this code firing at
the data layer level, I now can observe
that I can actually see that and that
trigger I is listening for anytime that
event gets submitted. And once that
event is submitted, I can then send that
data back to Google ads. So I can say
okay and what I'm doing here is I'm now
making a new tag. So to just take a step
back to what I've done is I've deployed
this Google tag manager code on my
website. So I've added this to the head
of the website and the body of the
website all over the the entire website
so that I can send all like basically
all this like data and information and
tracking back to it. And then I'm set up
that trigger that is listening for that
event. And then I also have this event
that's firing now from within the
application pushing that information to
the data layer. And once I have all of
this set up, I can now deploy something
like, okay, I'm going to say this signup
event, I want Google Ads, I want you to
uh do conversion tracking for when
somebody completes that sign up. So
within Google Ads, what I can then go
do, let me exit out of this. I'll go to
conversions.
I can create a conversion for that event
called sign up. And we'll try to
actually do this live. I don't know like
what it's going to allow me to because
this is like an old account. Um,
set conversions on the website. Get rid
of that.
Yeah, it's going to force me to have an
actual website. If you just go in
YouTube like how to connect uh Google
Tag Manager
uh connect Google Tag Manager
to Google Ads.
um Analytics Mania, um Loves Data, and
then Measure School are the two the
three best on this. They they do great
content. If you do any of those, like
this one probably would give you the
exact like walkthrough on how to do this
this conversion linker. Um but this will
have the tutorial on how to set this up.
Basically, what it ends up happening is
I can set up this conversion ad. And
what's what ends up uh looking what this
ends up looking like is I can have an
event that fires
that data gets sent back to Google ads
and then within Google ads I can
actually see the exact keyword that is
making signups and then I can see the
cost for the exact keyword that is
making signups. And this is what always
kills me with indie hackers. It drives
me [ __ ] insane is they are like oh
we're anti-paid ads. I'm like my god.
Like if you had an ATM where you put a
dollar in and $4 came out, what would
you do? What is their answer? It's like,
well, I would put as much money into the
ATM as I could. That is all ads are when
you set it up, right? It's like that is
literally the game here. And maybe if
this doesn't work for your industry
because it's too competitive, like for
lawyers, right? If you do like truck
accident lawyer, you know, Dallas,
right?
>> Yeah. Impossible, right? Like literally
impossible. Like $13 per CPC, like
you're going to be you're playing big.
you're playing you're playing pro ball
at that point. If you're bidding on some
like little ass tool or something like
that, like you can make this work. You
can totally 100% make this work. Man, it
drives me absolutely crazy that they
like say that this doesn't work. It it
it 100% can work. Like if if search if
organic search is working for you, paid
search will work for you. I guarantee
it. Most like nine out of 10 times like
very rarely 99 out of a 100red times it
will work. very rarely does it not work.
It's it's a it's a skill issue. It's not
that you're actually like like it's not
a channel that's going to function for
you.
>> Why do they say that? Is it a badge of
honor to not do paid ads? Is that why
they say that?
>> I think that's a part of it. I think
it's also like ego and they think like
product should distribute itself and
like all this. And I'm like, dude, like
if you're getting organic traction
naturally on YouTube, why wouldn't you
go and pay more creators to make videos
just like the ones that are getting
organic traction? Like it's it's so
funny to me like you talk to startup
founders and I I would see this when I
was in the valley where they're like,
"Yeah, like we're growing entirely
organically like 3% compounding month
over month." And I'm like, "Cool." Like
h what is actually happening? All right,
you're getting talked about in Facebook
groups to a cohort of people. So, let's
just turn on ads and see what happens. 7
days later, they have triple the leads
that they like had ever before. And
they're like, "Yeah, like our our
investors are like, "Go blow the seed
money as fast as you can." And I'm like,
"Yeah, I know." Like, "This is this is
like I I I think they just like they
they don't think in the economics of
this." And the economics are very
simple. It's like I pay a dollar and
then that turns into $5 a customer
lifetime value. But let's actually break
down what that means, right? So when I
put a dollar in or say, let's say I
spend $100, right? And my cost per new
customer is $80. So that I spend $100, I
get one new customer that cost me $80.
And this is like actual data. This is
from a company that I ran previously
that was like a SMB this this tile,
right? So the average customer life or
the average revenue per customer was
$39. So I was technically losing money
on getting that customer. I would pay
$80 to make $39, but the customer
lifetime value of that person was about
$550. So I'm paying $80 to make $550 in
customer lifetime value. So when these
absolute just like chuds are like, "Oh,
it doesn't work." Like the roaz doesn't
make sense. It's like, "No, it's a skill
issue." Look at the math. Like what is
your average customer lifetime value if
they're staying for 6 months and paying
you $100, right? That means that you're
making $600 per person. Okay? So, you
can afford to pay literally probably
like $150 to $200 to get that customer
and you're going to still make enough
money and make this make sense, but
they're like, "No, I want to like stay
core and do this." It just doesn't make
any sense to me. But again, it's just
different ways to run businesses. I It's
not the way that I would run it. I I
would I would I would layer all of this.
I would do paid ads. I would do organic.
I would do all of these things. But
that's just, you know, two different
ways to approach this. So, anyway,
that's my tirade. Thank you for coming.
Um, let's get back to the actual
scheduled programming. The, uh, so I've
set up that conversion event now. And
that conversion event is, uh, I would do
that for a signup and I would do it for
paid. So, you're probably asking now,
why wouldn't you just go immediately to
payment? Well, let me tell you, why did
we start at clicks and then we work down
to signups and then we work down to
paid? It's because I need enough
conversion actions to actually have
enough data to be able to make smart
decisions. So I start at clicks because
if I start with an immediately with
signups, I'm not going to have enough
data to understand like what are the
landing pages I should build that are
most likely to make signups. So once I
have enough signups, um then I can like
understand, okay, cool. Like I another
way to think about this is like if I
just turn on ads straight to payment,
I'm going to have so uh uh not enough
conversion events for it to train into
that payment action. And so I have to
focus on the the thing that's more
upfunnel and train it into that because
that is a leading indicator for this
like you know this more deeper funnel
action. And so it's it's basically like
if you have enough money though you can
go day one right? If you have 100 grand
like you're going to go straight to
conversion turn that [ __ ] on and within
seven days like you're going to be
optimized into it. But it just depends
on like the the resources that you have
the money that's available. For most
people that are bootstrapping or like
setting up, you know, they're
self-funding it, they're starting with a
smaller budget. And so that's why I
suggest the signup conversion to start
with. Once you have enough payment
conversion events though, you can always
swap that. You can say, "Hey, I want you
to optimize for the payment conversion."
Um, and Google Ads actually allows for
this. You can set the the value of the
conversion to be different uh numbers.
So I can say, "Hey, the signup's worth a
dollar and the payment is worth $10 or
$20." And so then it will start to have
that dollar amount that's uh uh attached
to the user action and will optimize for
that dollar amount like basically like
how like whatever budget you give it, it
will optimize itself into creating the
most like ROI from the dollar amount
that you've designated each of those
conversions. So that's Google Ads in a
nutshell. Very high level. There's way
more tactical stuff you could go into,
but like I you know we don't have time
for a master class. like we could do it
one day, but like if you just do that,
like it's it's going to work. Like
you're going to get you're going to get
something at least to start happening
like some some new DNA entering the the
the ecosystem that that you're you're
siloed in after you built this app that
nobody is like signing up for. Um
>> Peter Levels is silently silently
shaking his fist right now. I
>> whatever, man. Like I I you know how I
feel.
>> We all do. We all do. Okay. Anyways,
>> is there do we have time to go over, you
know,
>> do Facebook ads real quick because it's
very related to this? Um, and just like
run through kind of the whole strategy.
Um, and I think that that's probably a
good like stop point. Then we can come
back and we can do we can turn this into
a series where like we'll do a series on
cold DM and cold email. Those can be
paired and then we can do the next piece
which is like, okay, here's how to make
a content engine for your business,
right?
>> Comment if you want to see that.
>> If you want to see that, you better
comment. I swear to God, you better run
up Greg's comments right now. I will
respond to every comment that says, "Let
me like, "Show me the money. Show me the
goods. Show me the sauce." I will go
through every single one of them. I want
a thousand comments in the comment
section. All right. Okay. So, Facebook
ads um very different in how you're like
structuring uh the campaigns and also
like the the philosophical kind of like
the the framework behind it. So search
ads when somebody searches a search ad
so when they search this keyword phrase
um YouTube channel email extractor
they're signaling exactly what they're
looking for they are looking for YouTube
channel email extractor right um so you
have the search intent built into the uh
like you understand what what you you
need to show them to create the outcome
that you're looking for like you you
they're they're they're giving you that
search intent. Paid ads is different. Um
the reason for that is because you're
actually disrupting them. So this person
is actively in a mindset right now.
They're like, "Okay, I'm looking for
this thing." So if I get in front of
them and give them that thing, they're
already in that mindset. Paid ads is
different. I have to disrupt what
they're doing. I have to get their
attention and then I have to like tell a
story that gets them into the mindset
where they're malleable that I can
present a new solution that gets like
that convinces them to basically buy a
thing. This is why like you see all this
like [ __ ] on YouTube where they're
like, "Sudy psychology, bro. like you're
going to become like the best drop
shipper ever. And it's like [ __ ]
man. It's like very simple. It's like
talk about people's pain points, cast a
vision of a future that they can
potentially have, and then your product
is the bridge to get them to the future.
Okay? You just do those things. Like
you're you're top 1% of ads. Like that's
all that's all everything is. You want
to want an argument like you want to you
want to convince the world to not go to
war or go to war. like that is the angle
to do this. You might have to beep that
out, Greg. I apologize. Um, but the the
the it's just storytelling. That's all
you're trying to do here. And it's very
it's way less transactional than the
paid search side. You have to think
about that that component. So, let's
actually do this. Let's do this process.
So, I would go and I'd look like we'll
go back to Perplexity and I'd be like,
uh, give me pain points around uh, you
know, YouTube channel, email extractor,
Reddit. And I just be like, "Okay, like
how are people talking about it? What
are the pain points with this?" Like,
um, technical barriers users face issues
with YouTube recapture. Awesome. This is
sweet. Okay, cool. I got like a specific
thing I can talk to. API and scraper
limitations. They're limited by API
requests. Ethical and legal risk. Okay,
cool. We don't care about that. We're
living in the gray area in our life. Um,
the scam and security risks. Uh, this is
I mean that's just pulling from Reddit.
So, this is a pretty simple product. So
like technical barriers looks like the
main thing that you're solving. It's
pretty simple. What this will probably
be probably be um it would be like uh
you know the ad that I would probably
write is like if you do create if you do
influencer marketing marketing listen to
this like that's the hook and like let's
actually write this out. Let's write
this out like step by step. Um
so if you do influencer marketing
listen to this.
By the way, there's only like a hundred
hooks that exist.
>> Oh, yeah.
>> For in short form video.
>> Yeah,
>> absolutely. SAS, it's even smaller. I
would say there's probably like 25 good
ones and like maybe 50 that sometimes
work, you know, but like
>> it's all the same. But this is really
easy. It's like call out a thing that
somebody does and then present the
painoint. If you do influencer
marketing, listen to this. Finding
YouTube creator
emails is
uh a huge pain or sorry takes you know
we'll just say like takes hours finding
YouTube actually let's let's do this
find is this like a video that you're
you're writing the script for
>> yeah this is a video this is an AI
avatar video and the reason I'm
suggesting this is because AI avatar
videos we see those perform best for SAS
right now those in comics for some
reason I'm obsessed with the comics ones
like four panel comics where it's like
you're like telling a little story but
it looks like native content so people
are like oh this is just a meme and then
they're like [ __ ] it's an ad they're now
in a funnel it's amazing it works so
well I love it it's so so good uh before
and after comics work really well too
like here's where you are here's where
you can be if you do this thing dude
they just rip anyways but all right so
find me quotes about uh like technical
barriers
see what it says and I'm looking for
actual quotes of people saying this like
I worked on comparable prime extract the
challenge so bypass the recapture so
bypass the recapture perfect right
there's a limit so we're going to say uh
finding or uh getting uh YouTube creator
emails
>> couldn't you say
>> super hard because it bypassing the
recapture
you know sorry go ahead
>> I was going to say like to take this
even a step further, instead of saying
get YouTube creator email super hard
because by c bypassing the re the
recapture and provide me what like
making it more personal and being like
uh I almost blew my brains out
after trying to get a thousand YouTube
creators emails because of bypassing the
recapture or something like that. Maybe
not blow your brains out but something
like visual, right? I almost
>> I wanted to unlife myself because I had
to get emails behind recaptures and
build like 10 Google accounts to get a
100 emails. I have done this manually in
the past. It's terrible. Don't ever do
this. Please, I beg you. But yes,
talking exactly to that painoint like
speaking to that. That's all we're
trying to do here. And like what I'm
going to be able to do live is going to
be way shittier than what I would
actually be able to do if we like sat
down and did this. Um but I mean let's
just take yours. I think that's actually
like it's a better ad. So, like um like
if you're an influencer marketer or uh
if you do influencer marketing listening
to this um uh like
what what did you say, Greg?
>> I mean, I said blow blow my brains out,
but that's a bit too extreme. So, maybe
like
>> I don't know what's what's a bit more
Okay, we can just for the sake of this.
I want to blow I want like uh Yeah, I
want to blow my brains.
I want to blow my brains out trying to
get to get YouTube influencer or YouTube
creator emails
because the capture
because the capture
uh because the capture is hard to bypass
and I told my friend this
uh
friend this who's a a little bit shady,
who does a little bit shady internet
marketing. Um,
and uh he told me I should uh I should
uh uh I should check out this tool
called X
um X does Y thing.
So like X uh X scrapes
YouTube channel emails
um at scale.
You just give it a list and it returns
the emails.
It bypasses the capture for you and it's
uh saved me from my hemorrhoids
and
shitty joke.
Anyways, um so like I've got this ad and
now I what I wouldn't even I I don't
even know if I'd mention the ad name as
well. Like I found that like sometimes
just like calling it the app I like like
check out this tool this this uh tool
that scrapes emails scrapes emails. Um,
I upload
a list of YouTube channels
URLs
and it returns the emails
by bypassing the capture,
you know, for me,
whatever, right? And then like uh click
the link like click the link to learn
more. like don't you don't even like say
the app because then it like creates
like this like well I want to know what
this is now right and then like you'll
just see like sometimes you'll see
higher CTR and all of this is anecdotal
this is not have data so like this is
anecdotal data to support this every
industry is different take everything
I'm saying with a grain of salt but this
is like a it it something in this
vicinity will work okay so I take that
and then I would go and I would go to
hey Jen and I would use an 11 labs voice
I don't know if I want to give away this
sauce but I'm do it cuz again I'm
feeling generous today. Natasha Valley
Girl on 11 Labs absolutely crushes it.
The voice is unbelievable. It It is so
good. It is so good. So you do that and
then the avatar you just like honestly
hot girls work the best. So that's like
what I would suggest you do UGC.
Um and like these are ripping right now
when it's kind of this like podcast
style.
um or like car ones where it's like
casual. Again, use something like this.
I like test all of them honestly. Um but
then you'd go in, you select one of
these. We'll just do her to begin with
for No, I don't want it. Oh [ __ ] they
changed everything. H
they suck. All right, I'm going to
change it from Izzy. I want my voices
Natasha Valley girl. Baby, marry me. Um,
so then I would go and I you listen
through this and you would generate that
video, download it, and then at that
point you take it into like cap cut or
to script and you're going to remove the
silence so that it has like fast pacing,
add captions, and then for like the hook
section, you want to add uh like a title
um that is at the top of it. And you
might be able to do this in here now.
Actually, hold on. Let me let me just do
this little like add these. Oh [ __ ] All
right. Um I'll change this
the white or whatever. I don't know. You
know, some something that makes sense.
Um you're trying to make it look as
platform native as possible. So that's
the thing to remember with this. And
then I would add text. Let's add a
title. I don't know if it's going to
allow you to do this, but you do
basically the title would you'd have it
want to appear just for that section.
So, actually, I'm gonna just
I don't know how good this is. This is
like literally I think they launched
this today, which is crazy because I was
just in here this morning and it didn't
have this. So, um
>> yeah, but anyways,
>> they just launched this today like a few
>> interesting interesting. Um but anyway,
so what you're doing there basically is
you are building out this ad within the
application. Um you're we're going to
run through this. So, uh you have a
generate the avatar. You then shorten
the word gaps so that it's like faster
pacing. Um, add captions, add a title
that's like some type of hookie title.
Um, where it's like influencer marketing
easy mode, right? Or some I don't know,
whatever. Test a bunch of different
ones. Um, and have that be for the hook
section of the of the ad. And then you
go make 10 different variations of that.
So, you're going to take this ad and I
would go to Claude because Claude's got
the vibes. He's just I mean Clode. Is
that what you call him? Right.
>> That's what I call him. Yeah. code.
>> Nice. Be like be like big dog. Rewrite
this
add script five times, right? And then
just look at the variations, the one you
like, just kind of reiterate like over
and over on top of these, right? Um, and
you can build like automations for this.
Like you use like, you know, whatever
Gum Loop or Lindy to like automate this
whole process. I would suggest that
probably give it good examples of like
here's ad structures, hook examples, all
that. You can make this way more
advanced, but this is the simple
version. But once I have that, I then go
and I do Facebook ads. You're going to
target all of Facebook. So, Facebook has
gotten so good at understanding the
person that's most likely to sign up for
this thing that you're trying to
promote. All that matters is you make
good creative now. But how do you make
good creative? You test a bunch of
creative. So, go test 40 different ads a
month. And what you're going to find is
like two to three of those are just
going to crush the rest of them. Those
two to three, you're going to do a
conversion campaign. And so that that
event that we just set up for uh within
Google Tag Manager, I can use that same
event, but I can do that event as a HTML
custom conversion. So I would deploy the
the Facebook ads pixel and then I would
deploy the custom event for that signup
conversion. So let me show you what that
actually looks like. We'll say write a
Facebook ad event for signup. It's going
to like write this create write this
script. Um, and so like this script
right here is all you need. And what
that's basically doing is it's sending a
event back to Facebook for when that
user action is occurring. So our user
action is the signup event. We're now
sending that back to Facebook so that I
can track that user action. And you can
do this also for like if there you want
them to schedule a demo or stuff, you
know, whatever. You can do this for, you
know, kind of any any user action that
you want within the application. Um, but
then all you're doing is you're
basically testing all this ad creative,
letting them compete against each other,
and then when you find a winner, all the
budget goes there. But what you'll see
is that that ad will get what's called
ad fatigue. So if a person sees an ad
too much, you know, when you watch TV,
Greg, and you're like, I've seen this
[ __ ] Doritos commercial, you know, 20
times, man. Like I I just tune it out.
So people do that with, you know, social
media ads as well. And so the strategy
here is you're constantly refreshing the
ads so that it set that none of them go
stale and you take the winners and you
remix those over and over again. You
change hook variations, but maybe you
find these pain points work. You just
look for the common threads for like
what's most successful. That's it, man.
That's paid ads for SAS. That is the
that is like the vibe code thing that we
could go into details on like how to
actually track this. Um you can get all
of this data into like a a data
analytics platform like Looker Studio is
often what's used. It's a pain in the
ass to learn. Or you can use my app.
This is the shill. You just sat here for
an hour. So, we're now going to shill
it. Uh you can use graph.com. It'll
oneshot dashboards for you. You don't
have to learn how to use the tool. I can
say, you know, show me clicks week overw
week for my Facebook ads and it goes and
builds that. Does that for Google ads,
does that for my Google Analytics, etc.
Uh, go sign up for free. It's a free
14-day trial. Um, and yeah, that's it,
man. Any questions I can try to answer
before you cut me off and get me out of
here? Cut me loose, Greg.
>> Uh, thank you, Cody. I want to give one
quick little little piece of sauce I'm
sure you know about, but I'm not sure
everyone knows about or maybe you don't
know about this one. So, did you know on
Instagram you you can do trial reels?
Have you heard about this?
>> Yes, I have heard about this. I've never
ran them. I heard they can uh they like
rip though because it like tests it to a
huge wide audience for free, right?
>> Yeah. So basically if you go and create
like as as you're saying basically go
and create 10 15 20 different pieces of
creative
uh and you can I think you might need to
be a creator account or professional
account on Instagram but there's a
setting in there that says enable trial
reels. Enable that trial reels thing and
then upload
uh one one of your videos which is a
real. Yeah, exactly. Um, and it'll
literally
share the reel with nonfollowers
for free. So, you can see if it's gonna
resonate with people.
>> So, it's basically it turns it into Tik
Tok mode and they're giving you this for
free. So, some degenerate out there,
listen to me. All right? You're going to
go make like a hundred uh Instagram
accounts, okay? And you're going to
trial reels all of the hundred Instagram
accounts. you're never going to actually
post anything on any of these things,
right? And that's a way for you to go
get free reach at scale probably.
There's something in there that you can
probably game. But anyway, gee, that
that's such a good idea, too, cuz like
then you don't have to do any ad spend
on the testing. So, you skip that step,
right? You get to go right to the
conversion event rather than having to
do like the, you know, the click events
or, you know, whatever else that you
need for the testing. It's a super good
insight.
>> Cody, it was an absolute honor having
you on today. Thank you for sharing.
We'll include links to follow Cody
uh and his products. And uh you know,
hopefully come come on again for another
little tutorial like this.
>> Whenever you have me back, Poppy, I'm
still shocked that you have me here
after I robbed you. I mean, it's crazy
to me. I was down in Miami. I learned
his address. We came in. We took the
good art. No, I'm just playing. Thank
you, G, for hosting me as always, man.
It's It's always a pleasure. So
>> that that's a story for another day.
That's a story for another day.
>> Yeah. Yeah. We'll keep that we'll keep
that in the keep that in the in the
holster. So
>> all right. Catch you later, man.
