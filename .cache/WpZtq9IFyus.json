{"transcript": "Everyone talks about accelerated\ndepreciation and locking in huge paper\nlosses, but when is that actually true?\nAnd what do you really need to do to\npull it off? Let me show you exactly how\nit works and how skipping one tiny step\non the return can cost you hundreds of\nthousands of dollars in year 1\ndeductions. And it's the type of mistake\nthat cannot be amended retroactively.\nOnce it's missed on the original return,\nyou are done. And I'm Jasmine Deluchcci.\nI'm a practicing tax attorney, CP, and\nagent. I got my first tax license in\nhigh school. And in today's video, we're\ngoing through the real tax law on\naccelerating real estate depreciation,\nnot the fantasy version sold to you by\nreal estate gurus pitching their latest\ncourse or investment. In this video,\nI'll break down four things. First, how\ndepreciation really works. Second, what\na cost segregation study is and why it\ncan supercharge your year 1 tax savings.\nThird is the one-page piece of paper\nmost accountants skip on your return and\nwhen left off, it destroys your entire\ndepreciation benefit. And finally, how\ntax-savvy investors structure real\nestate to lock in permanent tax savings\nyear after year. First, how depreciation\nreally works. When you buy real estate\nlegally, you're not allowed to deduct\nthe purchase price all at once. Right?\nSince you've purchased an asset, instead\nyou get to take a tax deduction called\ndepreciation, which is a way of\nrecovering the cost of the building\nslowly over time. So, here's the rule.\nResidential rental property has a 27 1/2\nyear recovery period. Commercial\nproperty has a 39-year recovery period.\nSo, if you buy a $1 million commercial\nbuilding, you don't deduct a million\ndollar in year one. Instead, maybe\n$200,000 is for land, which is not\ndepreciable, leaving 800,000 as a\ndepreciable asset. That gives you only\nabout $20,000 a year in deductions every\nyear for nearly four decades. That is\npainfully slow, especially when you're\ntrying to reduce taxable income today so\nyou can take that money and invest it in\nmore assets. And that's why investors\nlook to accelerate depreciation to take\nthe deductions when they're most\nvaluable. Second, let's get into it.\nOkay, what is a cost segregation study\nand why does it matter? It's an\nengineering based analysis that\nreclassifies part of your building into\nshorter lived assets. For example, if\nyou have a $800,000 building value, then\na cost segregation could identify, for\nexample, $100,000 as five-year property\nfor equipment, appliances, and flooring,\n$140,000 as 15-year property for parking\nlots, landscaping, and other\nimprovements, leaving only $560,000 as\n39-year structural building. Here's the\nkey. Property with a life of 20 years or\nless qualifies for bonus depreciation\nunder IRC 168K. So instead of just a\n$20,000 in year one depreciation, a cost\nsegregation can generate $240,000 of\nimmediate deductions, that's the huge\npaper loss that everyone talks about.\nAnd when done correctly, meaning the\nloss is classified to match the type of\nincome you need to offset, whether\npassive or non-passive, it can wipe out\ntaxable income and slash your year one\ntax bill. All right. Third, let's go\nthrough the tiny step on your return\nthat most accountants and definitely\nmost self-prepared returns miss. And\nthis is where it unravels fast. Okay,\nyou've heard you can save big with real\nestate paper losses. You even invested\nin a cost segregation study. You're\nthinking you're all set. Okay, but then\nyour attorney correctly tells you to put\nthe building in a separate LLC and lease\nit back to your operating company.\nLegally, that's smart for asset\nprotection. But tax- wise, it creates a\ntrap. The IRS now sees two separate\nactivities, okay? The self- rental\nactivity, passive if it shows a loss,\nand the operating business, which is\nactive. Okay? And without the election,\nthe IRS treats those activities as\ncompletely separate, which means all of\nthose accelerated depreciation\ndeductions from your cost segregation\ndon't reduce your business income at\nall. They get trapped as passive losses,\nand passive losses can't offset your\nactive income. They just sit there\nsuspended until you have passive income\nor sell the property. This is exactly\nwhat happened to one of my clients\nbefore becoming a client. Okay? The\naccountant filed the return, skipped the\nelection, and suspended $200,000\nin first year depreciation deductions\nafter having the client perform a cost\nsegregation. And the worst part, you\ncan't fix it later. Okay? The grouping\nelection must be on the original return.\nYou cannot add it later to change the\ntax treatment from passive to active.\nThe fix is simple. Okay? You check a box\ninside the tax software that elects to\ngroup the activities allowed under the\nTreasury regulations. Okay? It is a\none-page statement added to the return\nthat says you're grouping the rental in\nthe business as a single economic unit\nbased on common ownership control and\ninterdependence. With that election,\nyour rental losses offset your active\nincome. Miss it and your deductions\ndisappear. Finally, here's how savvy\ninvestors create permanent tax savings\nfrom real estate. Okay? They time cost\nsegregations strategically using them in\nhigh income years when the deductions\nreally matter. They pair cost\nsegregations with the right elections\nlike grouping for self- rentals and real\nestate professional status or even with\nshort-term rentals where they materially\nparticipate so the deductions can\nactually be used instead of suspended.\nThey plan for depreciation recapture.\nRight? A cost segregation actually\nincreases the tax rate on depreciation\nrecapture on sale. So savvy investors\nline up 1031 exchanges or other deferral\nstrategies to keep the IRS out of their\npocket. And they keep building the\nportfolio. Each new purchase creates\nfresh deductions, right? and they often\nborrow against appreciated properties\ntax-free. In the end, many pass\nproperties to their heirs with a step up\nin basis, meaning no one ever pays tax\non the built-in gains. In other words,\nanyone can generate short-term paper\nlosses, but the real winners design\ntheir strategy so the savings don't\ndisappear later. They convert temporary\ntiming benefits into permanent tax\nadvantages. So, here's the bottom line.\nCost segregations can be powerful, but\nonly when paired with the right planning\naround passive loss rules and long-term\nexit strategy. Okay? Do them in the\nwrong situation and depreciation\nrecapture can actually increase your\ntaxes.
