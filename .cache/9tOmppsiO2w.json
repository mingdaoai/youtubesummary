{"transcript": "So you want to start a startup maybe you want to build it with AI Maybe it's a SaaS maybe it's a consumer social app But one of the hardest parts is getting thousands of customers to come to your product on autopilot right well I brought on Jack Fricks who Built a startup. It's now doing I think 15 or $20,000 a month in revenue and He did it by Just posting on Instagram building in public. He shows us how he does it And then we use AI to come up with ideas for how you can do it too Stick around for this entire episode some real takeaways for anyone who wants to build an audience from scratch and get customers on autopilot The startup by this All right, we got Jack Fricks on the pod he I mean, I'm not gonna say you're an overnight success But you're now making 20 grand a month building in public Yeah, I wanted to have you on to teach us how you're doing it So that other people could could copy you Yeah, I'm excited to be here. Thanks for having me overnight success. Yeah, something like that Well, it's a thing we were talking about that before we hit record is like Even this podcast like you know, I've been doing it for four years No one listened to it and then it started to pop off and now people see the podcast and I'm like, oh wow That's really you know you've always crushed it But the reality is this I'm sure the same with you right like you haven't been doing 10 15 20 K a month forever No, not even close four or five years before that of basically nothing so It all happens really fast though when it does happen so can't complain but if people stated the end of this episode What will they tactically learn? I'm gonna share today basically exactly what I used to start making lessons your dollars a month To market my mobile apps and user-ganic marketing like social media posting on Instagram TikTok Just like how to make money with these platforms by driving traffic to your app for zero dollars That's like my main thing. That's what I'm most knowledgeable about so if they stick around they're definitely gonna know how to do that and When you say app do you mean specifically mobile apps should people who are not building mobile apps like Click out of this episode Honestly, no, I think the skill of social media and organic marketing like you can drive traffic to anything Just like I think consumer facing things are much easier So like even if you're not building something consumer facing I think this is extremely valuable because like Whatever you learn for how to get attention is gonna transfer to any business still cool Alright, so today we're gonna learn how to get attention if you have no attention to begin with and how You can take that attention monetize it send it to your SaaS app mobile app and And that's what we're gonna do. All right, you want to Share your screen and we can begin. Yeah, I'll do that Basically the way that I've learned how to do marketing because I didn't never had money for ads And I didn't like ads was organic social media posts and what specifically that means is videos You can post on Twitter. I've done this a lot. It's helped me grow one of my other businesses but Organic social media posts on Instagram and TikTok you don't need a following to start this I had zero followers when I started these pages. I've done it multiple times. I have multiple pages for the same app Video content is just so easy to make It's low effort and You can make it low effort you can make it easily and you can like spam it out there and get a bunch of eyeballs on your product for Zero dollars. You don't have to start from anywhere. So that's what I'm gonna be talking about right now Yeah, basically I have a guide on Twitter and all of this It's my pinned tweet on Twitter. It's been used by lots and lots of people And there's some common pitfalls people fall into and that's I'm gonna go over right now and some like just basically tips You could use to actually Like get say a thousand downloads this month or a thousand visitors to your website For free. That's what we're gonna focus on Cool. Yeah, I mean I'm looking at this and it you're making it almost feel so easy But it's like well, how did you come up with the idea for this type of content, right? Maybe we're gonna get into that Yeah, so honestly as you can see here kind of sneak peek on this page I only post one type of content. It's two by two images with a caption I found this format well. I was iterating like I made hundreds of videos before I found that format and Now I'm just low effort putting these out there and they still get results So like most people might stop milking something or stop using something because it's they've used it so many times But I you I don't because if it still gets results, I'm gonna keep using it I mean that just makes sense to me and like How does someone who doesn't have an idea for this format or a format like how do you come up with ideas for formats? Yeah, so that's like the first step honestly and getting into like organic social media is you need to find ideas And it's actually not hard All you have to do is what I do is I make a new account for whatever business I'm in that's the first step to doing this you make a new account because it's just easier this way and you can Then use this new account and follow content in your niche You're gonna find a ton of content that's already viral For your target audience if you're scrolling and only engaging with your niche And then you just save it for later like I found a video when I was scrolling on this page My curiosity quench page, which is one of my apps I made this had zero followers and I the scrolling in my niche which was like hobbies Anti-dume scrolling like these niches and I saw like this two by two video. I had like a million likes So I tried it with um, I tried it with first like Things to do instead of scrolling that didn't work. I s iterated. I went to hobbies One of them blew up to like 10k views which was abnormal because I was stuck below a thousand And then I made it again one of them had like a hundred k views That is a very quick example it usually takes a few tries like 30 to 40 to 100 But like if you don't have ideas you just scroll in your niche and save videos like click that save button when you're scrolling And then I just looked at them later when I go to create a video. I do one a day When I'm trying out new formats and just like mix it up every single day basically and try something new and then iterate on it if that makes sense our formats universal meaning Could you look at you know, do you have to scroll your niche? Because Sometimes you'll find a format in another niche that You know in your niche people actually haven't tapped into and there's an opportunity to use that That's proven in that niche and bring into yours Yeah, that's actually a really good angle. I think most people you could definitely yeah You definitely could bring formats to like that aren't in your niche to your niche I think that works um because like this two by two format it's just one example There's you could do anything But this could be applied in like a million different ways you can write a different caption You can have different pictures of anything Um, and that could be applied when I first found it in hobbies to food and that's what I actually did do that Um, just because I was slow effort. I did do that. I made this page and I made 30 posts on it Um, from my food app and one of them hit like I think two million because this is like a four a format that's validated In another niche and I brought it to this one So yeah, answer your question. Yes, you absolutely can bring other formats over the reason I just said for starting a new account is Like for algorithms to know who to push your content to if you have a new account It's best if you only scroll in your niche just because Then when you make your first video post it knows who you're going for so that's important. I think to know Um, but if you're like scrolling on a different page and you see a format you could definitely still reuse it Good tip. Good tip. I never thought about that Sam Altman the co-founder of open AI just said that it is the era of the idea guy and he is not wrong I think that right now is an incredible time to be building a startup And if you listen to this podcast chat so you think so too Now I think that you can look at trends To basically figure out What are the startup ideas you should be building? So that's exactly why I built idea browser.com every single day You're going to get a free startup idea in your inbox and it's all backed by High quality data trends how we do it people always ask we use AI agents to go and search what are people looking for And what are they screaming for in terms of products that you should be building and then we hand it on a You know silver platter for you to go check out Um, we do have a few paid puns that you know take it to the next level Give you more ideas give you more AI agents and more almost like a chat gbt for ideas with it But you can start for free idea browser.com and if you're listening to this I highly recommend it Yeah, I mean that's that I think a lot of people do reuse old accounts and it can work But I always just say like I just started fresh account zero followers is actually using an advantage Because if I have an account Let's say I have a personal account and I start posting content that is not relevant to my audience Instagram pushes that video out to your audience first or like whoever your audience was or things It is before and if it doesn't resonate with them It's not going to push it out to a huge group of people to find a new audience Whereas a new account. It's going to test It's going to test like different audiences Which is really the great part of having a new account is you get that like huge widespread possibility of reach So you don't want to skip out on that I think Cool All right, so step one is you're scrolling in your niche. You got a fresh account. You're figuring out a format What's next? First definitely don't rush that phase you don't want to post content on a brand new account in the first I'd say week I used to say two days three days, but like oh week because you don't want the algorithm thinking you're bought you want them thinking this guy is A human and we want to push this content out there when the time comes so For the first week I would not post any videos and when you do post your first video only post like one a day If you're going to post multiple spread them out a few hours at least like three four hours Especially for new accounts though. I just do one a day then you have time to iterate on content And you want to keep that account in good standing you don't want any algorithms thinking you're doing like some bought behavior So you also want to post manually I've run a social media scheduling tool and I tell people do not use my tool for the new accounts you want a good Like a good standing account, which means you want to do everything I guess buy the book like a human would do it at least for the first like bit until your accounts warmed up Um, and then after that after you've warmed up the account you've waited a week and you post your first content um, really it's all just about testing new pieces of content Um, I think something important which I mentioned in the guide is obviously you're doing this to get views to your business So you don't want to just make content for max views you want to make content that's highly relevant to what you're promoting And that's where some people will be like I have a hundred gave views, but I only got two signups Which is very common for like low effort videos Because usually they don't have either a call to action in the video Or they're not like pinned comment is directly go download this app for this result And it's related to the real and also the main caption like it has to be telling people to go download it And what it's called or use it or the website link otherwise like no one's gonna care. They're gonna scroll to the next real So you have to kind of spam it in their face But even if it but you don't have to put it in the video like some people they make ads That's like the biggest mistake for making organic content. It should not look like an ad if it looks like an ad They're gonna scroll the algorithm's gonna give it 20 views and that's that you might as well have not made the content And yeah, I mean like After you found your content or a piece of content You post it if it works and you get 10,000 views first try 100,000 views Well, I guess just keep doing that But usually that's not the case usually people end up having two post 30 videos Before they see something like do well And that's if they're making changes and iterations to improve and test new angles on each video Which most people don't which is where they get stuck and I think that's another pitfall Is making the same video over and over again expecting something to change Well, when usually like it doesn't I guess do you have any questions On that um, I think I've ever you know have ever used many chat because I'm just thinking about You know Yes, I can create a video and at the end I could be like download my app if you want more of this Yeah, I'm seeing the this trend around like comment X and I'll send you a link Yeah, many many chats actually is pretty good. I've I used it before um before I actually saw any success like on social media. I was trying it But I never I disabled it and then I realized now like actually I should probably use that now Many chai is very good. Yeah, like comment X and then it DMs them the link to the app or something That's actually that's actually a really good addition to this that I Have overlooked for a long time now that I realize it. Yeah, I think that's a huge thing especially for Business to business things are like tools and guides You could definitely use like tools like many chai like automations are probably a huge addition If you can get the initial virality like if you're just doing um It's probably not as important if you haven't got anything that catches yet But yeah, once you get a working system or a working piece of content it could be huge so Let's take a quick detour for a second go to my instagram instagram.com slash my name Greg Eisenberg I'm literally going mini like a little bit viral right now and I don't have that many followers if you scroll down Um, so you go to reels Yeah, go to reels so this that that lost real I have many chats And it's like comment lca, which is our design agency um to get the playbook and If the comments aren't loading but the comments are broken but 123 comments that's that's a good thing I've been there so many comments at the comments are good Yeah, that's also very good for the algorithm I was going to have some people comment too Exactly, so this has been a light bulb moment for me because I've never thought about Instagram using Instagram as a funnel In intact we think a lot about x we think a lot about youtube but um There's just so much thirst for For software content on IG and using many vids to like Create an actual funnel so that it's not leaky is a has been a light bulb moment for me So you just started using to always like automation like you didn't use it anytime before literally no never zero I've never I just signed up for account. I saw that well. I knew I was going to chat with you And I was like I want to yeah, I want to basically this is what I love doing the podcast because it helps me get smarter on subjects And now I feel like I've got like a really good Sense for what IG is and how to create a funnel, but you just have to like go and post Yeah, yeah, and now and you already got the content down at this point so this is just going to be like Soup a lot of fuel to your fire because because as you mentioned too. It's not just the Funnel part like having people comment is a big part of what I'm trying to do when I make videos Like that's a piece of what you should make your content for is like people to engage with it Like if the algorithm sees people commenting they're gonna push it way further if they see them watching It twice over they're gonna push it way further So that's also a pretty important part, I guess of making organic content recap, I guess I think or maybe before we recap for for anyone who's making content And wants to make organic content. I would start for one post a day And then iterate and make it better or try something new try different formats every single day and tell something hits and Be patient with that because it might take a month or two Especially if you're doing this for the first time to see any real results and even then you Your results your views may not convert directly to signups because That's another skill in itself But if you can get eyeballs you can ultimately get Towards driving people to your business and making money from those eyeballs down the line at some point Totally. Yeah, I think your step your first step is basically to Get attention in the niche and then once you have that then it's like okay. I've got this attention How do I actually get them to the sass or mobile app or whatever it is that you know, I've built Exactly like the first skills attention grabbing getting attention the second skill is Converting that into like actual people going to your thing and Yeah, I mean that's the most simple recap of it. I guess the nitty-gritty details on how you do that um Really do come from just doing it like doing what I said like going to your account warming it up Waiting a week saving content creating content and That the creating content part like if you're someone who's new you just use cap cut like the simplest to lever I think like there's automations for everything, but if you can't do it manually There's no point of automating it because you're not gonna know what works and what doesn't And then once you've created like 100 pieces of content then maybe like I don't then maybe worry because it's gonna take good like it's gonna take a lot of iterations to get The skill to develop a taste of what actually drives attention. So if I'm hearing you right the the most important thing to do is Like if you're gonna try to 80-20 this is figuring out what is the format and yeah figuring out the niche and consistently posting Like that's really what it comes down to like if you can figure out a format that works in in a niche And you can consistently do it So my question is You know people might be listening to this and they might be like okay Greg and Jack really understand social They're really good at scrolling and able to identify these formats and come up with ideas I'm not as good as them at that and I don't want to spend five or 10 years of my life trying to get good at that Is there a way that AI could help you? um You know shortcut your way to figuring out the format that works. I Think To me, I think I think the only ways to shortcut formats are to like scroll on social media And you don't have to do it that much But you should like if you want to really know like what goes viral just Take 10 minutes a day and be it doesn't have to be for long you'll get the hang of it in like a week or two 10 minutes a day set of timer and scroll on social media and look like okay, what did well What is simple what can I create like what is not that high of effort because a lot of the videos out there like full productions You don't have to have a full production and then just like as I said like save those videos and try to recreate them I know that that's probably not the answer you most people want But I don't think like at this point I have been able to successfully use AI tooling to help me find those ideas It's just like it's not something I feel like it's outsourcible yet But like there is obviously once you find one format You can use that and you can use AI to pump out content for that format or help you idea idea on it Can we try that just for fun? Can we for example take a Image of let's say you're cooking out the yeah the cooking meme page. Let's take a let's take a screenshot of it Let's pump it into chat GPT and let's see Hey, you know, I want 10 ideas based on this. Let's see if it's actually good at it It's good that you have the the screenshot of the homepage, but I think I actually showing like Oh the actual app No, the um go to what's it called do my Instagram page? Yeah, the Instagram page Do you fat yeah like giving one of these like people who Oh, okay got you yeah, I got you like using this format title on Yeah, I saw this format. I'm the CEO of do fat. It's a food diary app Um, by the way, I love how we're just doing this live like Like we have no idea if this is gonna work or not, but let's you know, this is dope um help me What do we want as a result like versions of this or like cool new ideas Yeah, what do you think I think like if I'm It's like okay, I you know, I found a cool format, but I need more ideas And I want ideas that have a high likelihood of success So it's like I'm just gonna get you. I'm the CEO of do food diary app. I found Yeah, exactly I found this I'm just narrating for the people who are listening on audio I found this video format that gets views but I want some More ideas video for my ideas that can bring in more views for my that are related to But I want some more video format ideas that can bring in more views that are related to my food diary app Let's see what happens and then should like make it low at Make the ideas possible to create with low effort Like in in a simple video editor or is that is that too much? That's try it. I mean I'm gonna see I'm curious to because this format I've been I've been now autumn I've been working on assistant to automate the format Um like the two by two grids like you can automate the images I've done that that's that one is automated the one like that just showed you Um that one is automated like I made this with an automated system and I I'm working on blocking it But like yeah, I don't know about more ideas. That's what I'm curious to Because oh 10 more low effort ideas This versus that energy levels so split screen or swipe comparison How I feel after being a bagel versus open you with the berry? That's pretty good That could work especially slideshows are kind of hot right now. Yeah. No, that's actually that's actually pretty solid I think the hardest part is getting the copy right like you I'd say um direct your Direct AI to sound like Gen Z. It's pretty good at it use lowercase like those things kind of make it feel not AI Um foods that secretly drain you. Oh That's actually that's a pretty good. It's not bad ideas two for two Best food diary entries this week Uh, I mean, it's kind of it sounds like an ad but it sounds like an ad but it could be adapted like you could be like It could be adapted. It's it's something there's something there For relatable bad food mood skits. I don't know what kind of I don't know even know What it's trying to do Five underrated snack ideas that make me feel 10 out of 10. Okay snack ideas like slides or two by two Okay, that's not bad Foods I tested for seven days ranked by mood Uh, that kind of like an ad, but that could be interesting like a story Um type of content style What I log today in doof series to add that's like an ad. That's a much of an ad Yeah, like what I ate today and then you just have at the end like Or like an integration of it Blogging and doof that might work, but still not titled like that Uh foods that make you smart or dumb. Oh, that could be cool. You could like even show Logs in the app of it with the food Food mood equals mood swap Swap morning pastry Focus kind of weird. There's some ideas there. You're right like it definitely could help you find ideas especially if you're someone Who doesn't know what to post and you're seeing things on your for a you page when you're scrolling But you don't know like how to adapt it It could help you bridge the gap there I think It's obviously not autonomous you have to have some sort of like idea of what's gonna work And I think scrolling for 10 minutes a day for like a week would do that you know like You could train yourself pretty quickly But yeah, I mean you're kind of right This if I wanted ideas that to try new things other than that one format I mean this would help like yeah, so definitely help yeah, I think uh some other tips for people is You know you can say like pretend your jackfrix and jack is amazing at finding formats and here's what I you know I like that he he he he comes up with very simple ideas Um he talks like you know jenzy He isn't you know promoting his app all the time it feels very value-ad so you saying pretend like you're You're a brand or person is very helpful in terms of uh for goodness help. Yeah I didn't know that I've honestly not used um Chatgbt for ideation as much as I probably should But I definitely think people watching this should Use this tool because like this would save you a lot of time and effort Even if you're still using social media and like doing what I said scrolling This is gonna help you get to probably the same place faster Yeah, there you go Um anything else you want to add? Um, I mean I think the best thing if someone is like missing contacts they are like aren't sure Like what to do just like probably go to the guide I'm gonna keep saying that because it's like I can't say everything perfectly But if you can reread these things um and learn like the pitfalls of not warming up your account um and and keeping posting consistently and trying new formats just like Yeah, read the guide if you're unsure of what to do Also like make sure you warm up your accounts properly that is very important if you don't warm up your accounts properly You're gonna be stuck posting videos to the void that you're getting like you you should be able to get hundreds of views per video On a new account if you warmed it up properly if you're not then something is wrong You should probably stop posting But I mean I think anyone can do this like it's very accessible It doesn't take much to make content and I'm excited for people to try it And share like what they learned how they did Amen. Well appreciate you coming on. I'll include the link uh to the guide And I maybe I'll write my own notes on it as well um in the show notes And include where to find you on social so people can go and follow you Dude thanks for I by the way, I do agree with you like I think that anyone could do this um It does You know you you do have to do it for longer than you expect and and um and you do have to develop like a system Um and that takes time but um Um, you know we get numb to these numbers of like hundreds and thousands of views But like think of a stadium right like at stadium with 2,000 3,000 5,000 people That's a lot of people So when you see numbers like hundreds or a few thousands like don't be discouraged Those are real people who might buy your product we might download your app Um and might change your life. So jack thanks again for coming on and I hope you come back on soon Thanks for having me Later", "language": "en", "title": "I Built a $670/Day SaaS App with NO Paid Ads (Here's How)"}
