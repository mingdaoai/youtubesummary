{"transcript": "[Music]\nThis is Macrovoices, the free weekly\nfinancial podcast targeting professional\nfinance, high- netw worth individuals,\nfamily offices, and other sophisticated\ninvestors. Macrovoices is all about the\nbrightest minds in the world of finance\nand macroeconomics telling it like it\nis. Bullish or bearish, no holds barred.\nNow, here are your hosts, Eric Townsend\nand Patrick Szna.\n>> Eric, it was great to have Lynn back on\nthe show. She's always a listener\nfavorite. Patrick, Lynn, Alden, and\nquite frankly, almost every one of our\nother genius level macro guests seem to\nagree that the fundamentals for gold\ncouldn't be better. But let's face it,\ndisciplined investors would be\nchallenged to justify not taking profits\non an unhedged gold long after the\namazing run that we've just seen. And I\ndon't mind admitting that I'm feeling a\nlittle bit challenged myself in that\nregard. I don't want to abandon or even\ntrim down the size of my long gold\nfutures position. I agree with Lyn Alden\nand Luke Groman and all the other\nsmartest guys in the room that long gold\nis the place to be. But this trade has\nrun so far so fast. It needs some kind\nof hedge or asymmetry to it. And I'm\nstill levered long unhedged. So, how\nabout focusing the trade of the week on\nhow to hedge a big long gold position?\nSpecifically, I want to hedge the risk\nof a great big downside correction. I\nthink 300 bucks down here could easily\nhappen and it wouldn't even upset the\nbull story. So, I'd love to hear how to\neven further lever upside potential as\nopposed to having de to derisk here. But\nPatrick, obviously, you just can't\njustify too much leverage here with this\nmuch of an overbought market unless\nyou've got some kind of asymmetric\ndownside hedge. Assume for the sake of\nround numbers in this conversation that\nI've already got a long position on on a\n100 troy ounces of gold. So that's about\n$390,000\nat the price as of recording time. I\nwant to redeploy that $390,000\nto express a hedged version of my view\nthat, hey, look, there could easily be a\n$300 correction here. Could happen at\nany time, headlines, who knows what\nhappens. But we could also see $3,000 of\nupside in the next year if the world\nreally goes to And frankly, we\njust had two interviews from super smart\npeople, not selected by us, that seem to\nbe suggesting that's the direction.\nOkay, Mr. Options Man, what's the trade?\nListeners, you're going to find the\ndownload link for the postgame trade of\nthe week in your research roundup email.\nIf you don't have a research roundup\nemail, it means that you have not yet\nregistered at macrovoices.com.\nJust go to our homepage,\nmacrovoices.com, and click on the red\nbutton over Lynn's picture saying\nlooking for the downloads. All right,\nEric, let's go a little deeper into the\ngold trade you described. The first\nthing I have to point out is that some\nreally important parameters have to be\nnailed down before you even start\noverlaying option strategies. For\nexample, is the downside risk we're\nworried about a quick air pocket or a\nmulti-month grind lower? On the upside,\nwhile we know the longerterm potential\nfor gold is in the thousands, what's the\nrealistic short-term upside in the next\nquarter given how overbought the market\nis right now? Those details matter\nbecause they dictate the tenor of the\nhedge, the strikes you choose, and\nwhether you can use overlays like a risk\nreversal to reduce the carry cost by\nselling some of the upside. The key\npoint is whatever these assumptions are,\nthey can lead to creating literally\nhundreds of different iterations of this\nhedge. Once you pin down horizon, upside\nexpectations, tolerance for capp gains,\nand the carry cost, then you can\nengineer the exact structure. So, let's\nset the parameters for this\nillustration. The risk I'm hedging is a\nfourth quarter correction of 8% or\nroughly $300 an ounce. On the upside, I\nthink the fourth quarter headroom is\nmaybe another 10% about $400 an ounce\nfrom these already lofty levels. And\nI'll assume the core position is long\nbullion through the February 2026 gold\nfutures contract on the commex. One way\nto structure the hedge is with a put\nspread risk reversal. In plain English,\nthat means you buy a put to protect the\ndownside, sell a lower strike put to\nreduce the cost, and finance the rest by\nselling an upside call. The result is\ncheaper carry defined by protection\nbetween the two put strikes with\nrespectable upside before it's capped\n10% higher. Now, here's the overlay I'd\nrun. Now, if you want to follow along, I\nclearly broke down the numbers on the\ntrade on page three of the downloadable\nslide deck. So, step one, we buy the\n$3,800 put and sell the $3600 put. That\nput spread costs about $47 an ounce.\nNow, step two, we finance most of that\ncost by selling the $4,300 call, which\nis roughly $400 higher from the current\nspot prices for a credit of $31 an\nounce. The result, the net cost is about\n$16 an ounce instead of $69 for an\noutright put. Now, on a $390,000\ngold position, like you alluded to, that\nworks out to about a $1,600 premium.\nNow, what do you get? Well, between the\n3,800 down to $3600 level, you've boxed\nin $200 of downside protection, enough\nto neutralize most of the likely drawd\ndown. Now below 3600, you're unhedged\nagain, but then you've already softened\nthe volatility pain. On the upside, you\nare fully long up to $4,300 or 10%\nhigher. And only beyond that do you give\nup your gains. And remember that the cap\nonly applies to the remainder of the\nfourth quarter of this year. So, the\nbeauty of this structure is I've\nmeaningfully muted the downside, left\nplenty of room for the trade to keep\nworking, and I've done it at a fraction\nof the carry cost of an outright hedge.\nThat's the type of risk controlled\noverlay highly leveraged traders use to\nstay in high conviction trades without\nbleeding premium. Now, if paying about\n$16 an ounce for peace of mind over the\nremainder of the year makes sense to\nyou, this certainly is a structure worth\nconsidering. At the same time, if the\ncapped upside is a turnoff, you can\nalways just run the $3,800 to $3,600 put\nspread on its own. It costs about $47 an\nounce, but leaves all of the upside\nopen. So, the choice is simple. ultra\nlow cost with a cap or a higher premium\nwith no limits. That explanation worked\nfor the pros and of course our retail\naudience can get the full briefing by\nattending Patrick's Monday webinar which\nalways dissects the trade of the week in\ndetail. Macrovoic's listeners can get a\nfree trial at bigpicturtrading.com.\nNow Patrick warned you last week that\nBig Picture Trading's prices were going\nup on October 1st. But when I realized\nafter listening to that show that these\nguys were more than doubling their\nprices one day before our 500th episode,\num I gave Patrick a call and pushed back\na little bit and said, \"Patrick, um how\nabout if we extend that through the\nweekend so you don't screw up the 500th\nepisode?\" So, uh after a little bit of\npressure, it is now possible to\nsubscribe to Big Picture Trading for\nless than half of the new price that\nalready took effect on October 1st. But\nthat's only if you go to\nbigpicturetrading.commacrovoices\nand that expires Sunday, October 5th.\nThat is the absolute last chance to get\nthe old pricing and they are basically I\nmore than doubling it. So if you like\nbig picture trading and you don't want\nto miss the trade, now is the time.\n>> All right, Eric, let's move on to the\nchart deck. What are your thoughts here\non the equity markets?\n>> Well, everybody who's anybody has been\ncalling for a top. After all, the S&P is\nnow more than 10 times the 666 low that\nwe saw in 2009 in the wake of the great\nfinancial crisis. And the market just\nkeeps climbing that wall of worry and\nshrugging off all those bullish\narguments. In my experience, these\nthings always go longer, go higher, last\nlonger, take more time than anyone\nthought possible, and then they suddenly\nend when nobody expects it. Look, we're\nnot in the nobody expects it stage.\nWe're still in the most people expecting\nit or lots of people expecting it.\nThey're hedging because they're hedged.\nIt basically can't happen. So, I think\nmarket probably continues higher from\nhere. I definitely think the bare\narguments are real. They're going to be\nproven real someday. Could get really\nugly, but who knows? We could go another\nthousand points higher before we\nactually get that great big correction\nor bare market. Now, I know that sounds\ncrazy, but remember, we're at the\nbeginning of a secular inflation. At the\nbeginning of secular inflations, the\nstock market always overperforms\nincredibly well. Everybody thinks it's a\ngreat sign of the economy improving and\neverything's going to be wonderful. It's\nreally just inflation and the feedback\nloops that are really bad for the stock\nmarket haven't kicked in yet. So, I\nthink that's most likely what's driving\nthis. As far as what happens next,\nthough, I'm not sure. Well, Eric,\nthere's no denying that the bulls remain\ndecisively in control of this trend.\nNow, I've been saying episode after\nepisode that this has been uh not only\nthe longest uh rally that we've had with\nout a 5% correction this decade, but\nalso the largest in magnitude that we've\nhad without a 5% correction. Now, by\neither of those two metrics, that in\nitself doesn't guarantee a correction,\nbut this market is definitely in the\n100th percentile on that metric. Now, at\nsome point, a correction will happen,\nbut what has been amazing is that this\nmarket is completely resilient. so far\nto bad news. It continues to climb a\nwall of worry. Inevitably, something\nwill break this market, but there is\nzero sign of it right now. Not even the\ngovernment shutdown or anything like\nthis seems to be rattling these markets.\nIt'll be very interesting to see what\nultimately will be that news that comes\nout of left field that kind of surprises\nthe markets to begin a correction, but\nright now there is zero sign of that.\nAll right, let's move on to the dollar.\nWell, there's lots of bottom callers\nemerging saying it's the time to buy the\ndollar. Surely, it can't go lower than\nthis. But all I see on the chart is a\nperfectly normal sideways consolidation\npattern, and it's right in the middle of\nits trading range. Nothing to see here\nuntil we get a breakout below 96 or\nabove 100. Well, Eric, the dollar has\nclearly found a new fair value zone. We\ntested this 97 level once in April. We\ntested it again in June and we've been\nstuck in this trade range ever since.\nNow the primary downtrend is intact if\njust measured by something like a moving\naverage. But the sideways trade range is\nsimply a reflection the fact that there\nis a lot of confusion in the different\ncrossurrencies. Some of them the US\ndollar is rallying against others the US\ndollar is weakening against leaving an\nindex like this to be stuck in this\nmuddle. At some point the US dollar will\nshow its hand and that's going to be an\nimportant technical event. Now when I\nthink of it from a pain trade\nperspective there is a decisive amount\nof traders that are outright bearish the\ndollar and rightfully so. There's a lot\nof macro reasons behind that. But when\nyou think about what have been the best\nperforming assets including emerging\nmarkets throughout the 2025 year\nthinking of it from a pain trade\nperspective a short-term US dollar rally\nwould be incredibly disruptive to so\nmany different trends. So will we see\nthis kind of a pain trade emerge in the\ndollar or will simply the dollar bears\nprevail and the macro drivers the next\nleg down? It is certainly the puzzle to\nsolve. Right now, we are in the dead\ncenter of this trade range, and there's\nno real high conviction call to be made\nhere. Now, Eric, let's move on to crude\noil. As of recording time, we're still\nholding the September 5th low print\nright around 6150, but just barely.\nTrump wants lower oil prices and isn't\nafraid to play hard ball to get them.\nNow, I don't know exactly what's going\nto happen, but I think there's plenty of\nroom for Trump to uh push his way, at\nleast in the short term. I think\nultimately we see much higher oil\nprices, as Anest Alhaji recently\ndescribed. I think that that's clearly\nwhere we have to get to, but maybe we're\ngoing to push the prices down before we\nstart the war or something like that.\nI'm not sure. Let's see how it plays\nout. Well, there was a technical attempt\nto break out and I always like to tell\nmy members that one day doesn't make a\nnew trend. When that breakout towards\n$66 happened, almost immediately we\nfaded right back down to the bottom end\nof the range of the summer. Now, this uh\nin itself signifies that this was a\ntechnical false start and really that\nthere is no bull trend to be found here.\nBut at the same time doesn't mean that\noil is going to be bearish. Over the\nsummer, oil's been incredibly resilient\nto bad news and has held the line in the\n60s some odd dollar range uh\nrelentlessly for months. This leaves uh\noil very similar to the dollar in a big\nmuddle basically with no conviction\nshowing neither a trend to weaken nor a\nbull breakout. At some stage we're going\nto get a trend move and technically it\nwill be impossible to miss. We'll we'll\ndefinitely make the call when that\nhappens, but right now once again, you\njust have to assume that this trade\nrange will continue to prevail, at least\nover the short term. Now, Eric, let's\ntouch on gold. Well, you basically heard\nmy view embedded in my question for\nPatrick in the trade of the week. That\nview is that no professional investor,\nincluding me, could possibly justify\nholding as overweight of a gold position\nas I currently have uh in the market\nthat's this overbought. You just can't\ncall yourself a responsible, disciplined\ninvestor if you're doing that. So, the\nsolution, as far as I'm concerned, is\nnot to derisk because I think this could\nstill have a long way to go. I think\nit's time to re-risk into an asymmetric\nhedged position. And I loved Patrick's\ntrade of the week analysis for how to do\nexactly that. Well, Eric, the measured\nmoves on gold here are still up towards\nthe $4,000 an ounce. Well, some\nshort-term upside uh remains the path of\nlease resistance and there every single\ndip has been bought. There is no sign uh\nthat uh there and some sort of profit\ntaking or short-term distribution cycle\nhas begun. So, you have to respect that\nthis prevailing trend is intact. Um but\nthe like you were suggesting the\nasymmetry on the short term over the\nnext few months is at neutral at best\nwhere the upside potential is probably\nequal to the immediate downside\ncorrection risk. Uh, and so to me, any\nnew trades put on gold here do need to\nbe done with some sort of an option\nstrategy that creates either convexity\nand or some sort of a a payoff structure\nthat is asymmetric in the way it's\nconstructed. Now, Eric, that uranium\nrun's been going since April. What's\nyour thoughts here on how this is\nplaying out? I remain uber bullish\nlong-term, medium-term,\nof course, short-term is a little bit\nhard to call when we're this overbought.\nThe thing that's a really, really\nimportant signal that most people will\nmiss this week. Don't miss it. The\nlong-term contracting price, the term\nprice, that's the one that counts.\nRemember, the spot price is not where\nmost of the action is in the uranium\nmarket. The problem is the spot price is\nthe one that gets reported every day.\nTerm data only comes out once a month.\nTerm is finally moving higher after a\n15-month plateau between $80 and $81.\nThe one big problem is massively\noverbought technicals. Now, it looks\nlike we'll shake those overbought\ntechnicals off with the sideways\nconsolidation again before the next move\nup. I don't mind waiting. I'm still\ncounting my gains from the last surge.\nNow, Eric, there's two things I want to\nhighlight. First of all, we want to\nsplit up uh uranium versus that of\nuranium equities because when we're\nlooking at the prices of uranium\nstrengthening here and we look at things\nlike the spat physical trust uh unit,\nyou know, they are in the early stages\nof turning up and starting to reflect\nhigher demand uh for uranium and the\nprices are improving. But when we take a\nlook at those uranium equities, they've\njust had an epic half-year run where\nalmost all of them have doubled in their\nvalue. Th this is a little bit more of\nan overbought condition. We're already\nseeing a little bit of resistance where\nas uh we see advances or rallies in\nthese, they're immediately met with a\nlittle bit of selling. That in itself is\nnot a reversal pattern nor an indication\nthat this impulse is done. Obviously,\nthe long-term fundamentals remain\nincredibly strong and a great story, but\nsome profit taking will happen. as we\nalready seen the beginning of it. To me,\nthe primary bull trend is still intact\nand there could be one or two more bull\nimpulses to the upside. We'll be looking\nfor signs where u there's momentum loss\nor something that's pivoting the price\naction or heavy resistance starting to\nform. But that might take the whole\nmonth of October to really start\nemerging. Now, Eric, copper's been\nmoving. Let's uh let's have a chat about\nthis. Patrick, the glaring pattern on\nthe HGZ5, that's the US copper futures\nchart, the one that got whipsawed by\nTrump and Bessant, uh, in all of the\nback and forth on tariff policy. Uh that\nthat is basically showing an impending\n5200 death cross which would be hard to\navoid even if market's looking pretty\ndarn strong right now but it would have\nto be a whole lot stronger in order to\nprevent the 50 from crossing down below\nthe 200 which of course is known as a\ndeath cross. Patrick, uh, this is above\nmy technical analysis pay grade because,\nyou know, if this chart death crosses,\nthe popular wisdom is, well, that's a\nsuper bearish signal. But look, I don't\nthink the LME copper's chart would show\nany such pattern or anything close to\nit. The ugly pattern is on the HG chart,\nand it's because that chart is\ncollateral damage from the tariff\nturmoil. Patrick, how should investors\ninterpret a situation like this when you\ngot two different charts for the same\nthing showing opposite indications? just\nbecause one got whipsawed by tariffs and\none didn't.\n>> Eric, you're absolutely right in\nobserving the Trump tariff turmoil and\nits impact on the charts. Usually, as a\ntechnical analyst, you want to be able\nto look at a chart that is demonstrating\nproper flows, something that is showing\nthe way investors are voting with their\nmoney. The problem with the copper chart\non the ComX is that we went through a\nsubstantial gap higher and a devastating\ngap lower driven by short-term headline\nnews as tariffs on tariffs off scenario\nwhich really disrupts the charts price\naction making it very challenging to uh\ngive any validity to something like a\nmoving average crossover. Therefore, I\nwould put a lot less waiting on it. In\ngeneral, a death cross, one of the\nskepticisms is simply that both the 200\nand the 50-day moving averages are such\nlagards that by the time you have a\nmeaningful crossover, the the embedded\ntrend that's been in place to create the\ncrossover is quite oversold and often\nyou can get caught in some violent\nretracements when the signal arises.\nGenerally, I think it is a good signal\nthat depicts major bull and bare market\ncycles, but I'm always suspect of using\nit solely as a market timing tool, like\nthere is some edge in starting to\nexecute your trades when the actual\ncrossovers are happening themselves. The\nobservation I want to really highlight\nis that when we go to look at the LME\nfutures in copper in London, we have\nthem breaking to a one-year high, very\nclearly bullish at this moment. So I\nwould be very suspect of this copper\nsignal and I would focus a lot on\nactually whether or not copper continues\nto show new signs of accumulation\nbecause definitely ever since that\nFreeport McMoran event, copper has been\nvery well accumulated and making key\nadvances and so I'm actually looking to\nfade that signal at this point and\nseeing whether this trend can actually\npersist. Patrick, before we wrap up,\nlet's hit that 10-year Treasury note\nchart. What we have literally seen is\nthat at the start of the year in January\nwe peaked out with yields near 480 and\nuh since then yields have been\ndeteriorating down to 4% and even this\nlittle rally or bump that we saw in the\npost FOMC that saw almost 20 basis\npoints pop on the upside faded at a\nFibonacci zone and is already rolling\nover. Uh overall, I think the pattern of\nlower yields on the 10-year is a very\nclear trend and uh no reason to believe\nit's uh being disrupted and or having\nreversed. I would still think that\nthere's a very reasonable chance here\nthat we're going to see a trip under 4%\non the 10-year here uh in this fourth\nquarter. And that's uh what I'm going to\nbe continuing to trade looking uh for\nthat breakdown.
