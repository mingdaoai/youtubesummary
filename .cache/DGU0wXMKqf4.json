{"transcript": "wait to have a good idea before you\nstart a startup if you start a startup\nwithout a good idea um and you just kind\nof cast around for one you'll be under\npressure to make something up it won't\nwork that well the very best startups\nare all started because someone believes\nso passionately in an idea and they\nbelieve that a startup is the best way\nto make that\nhappen one of the things that is really\nhard about good ideas is that original\nthought is really hard most people just\ncopy somebody else's thoughts most\npeople do what somebody else is doing\nand this is disastrous because if you\nhave one idea that starts to work and\nyou have 10,000 clones that follow it\nnone of you are going to be successful\nand the person that started first that\nyou all copied is very likely to win you\nknow in the year after Facebook started\nthere were well over a th000 social\nnetworks that started in the year after\nInstagram started there were well over a\nthousand photo sharing apps that started\nbut you want to do something that is new\nand different you want to think of an\nidea that's not the same idea everybody\nelse is working on\num the year that I joined the board of\nhelon which is a nuclear fusion company\num according to somebody's count there\nwere 10,000 photo startups of some sort\nor other started that year and one\nnuclear fusion startup started which\nseemed a little bit off to me um but I\nthink most people just do what everybody\nelse is doing right then noticing\nproblems in your own life is is\ncertainly a good way to do this um it's\nnot true that all successful startups\nare sted to solve a problem that the\nfounders have themselves but is a very\nhigh percentage if you really go back\nand think about the transformational\ncompanies um most of them start with\nsomeone solving their own\nproblem and then there's this idea of a\nGreat Wave which is that another thing\nyou notice if you go back and look at\nall the really successful companies is\nthere was this massive wave of\nTechnology\ncoming you could see it in the distance\nand you knew was going to just like\ncrash over the shore and through the\ncity and you got out there early on your\nsurfboard um so I think it's really hard\nto create a technology wave as a startup\nthat takes too much too many resources\nyou can't do that but what you can do is\nnotice that a wave is coming and\nUniversity students are particularly\ngood at this you can notice that a\ntechnological wave is coming um and\nwhile other people still think it's a\ntoy or not going to matter you can\nreally get conviction behind it and surf\nsomebody else's wave and this by the way\nI think is the reason that great compan\nthere tends to be these clusters in time\nwhen a lot of great companies\nstarted so you know when the the\ninternet wave happened in the the mid to\nlate 90s um you had a huge cluster of\ncompanies that are now very large Amazon\nGoogle um Yahoo I guess uh others um and\nand then when the mobile wave happened\nafter after the iPhone came out 20072\n2008 you had this other big wave of uber\nAirbnb Snapchat um Instagram WhatsApp in\nthis short period of time right after\nthis this new wave started and a really\ngood question to ask is what is the wave\nthat's starting right now and where is\nthe cluster of companies because we're\nabout due for another one where's that\ngoing to\nbe", "language": "en", "title": "Sam Altman explains how to come up with a great startup idea"}
