{"transcript": "Here's a statistic I've been thinking\nabout recently. In 1976, about 40% of\nhigh school seniors had read six books\nor more for fun. In the last year, only\nabout 11% hadn't read a single book for\nfun. Today, those numbers are basically\nreversed. About 40% haven't read a\nsingle book for fun. If you are looking\nfor this, you see it everywhere right\nnow. There are all these headlines about\nhow kids are not reading the way they\nonce did. There are all these stories\nquoting professors even at Ivy League\nuniversities about the way in which when\nthey try to assign the reading that\nthey've been assigning their entire\ncareers, their students, they just can't\ndo it anymore. We're losing something.\nWe can see it on test scores that over\nthe last decade we just see the number\nof kids reading at grade level slipping.\nThen of course the pandemic accelerated\nthat.\nSo if you were simply asking how are the\nkids doing on some of these intellectual\nfaculties that we once thought were the\ncore of what education was trying to\npromote, they're not doing well. And\nthen as if we summoned\nit, as if we wrote it into the\nscript, here comes this\ntechnology, generative AI, that can do\nit for them. Imagine you could read any\nbook in less than 30 seconds. no matter\nhow long it is. That'll read the book\nand summarize it for you. Any style\nnon-fiction book in 10 minutes that'll\nwrite the essay for you. GPT is going to\ndo the bulk of the writing. Copilot is\ngood for factual information and GPT0\nhelps you not get caught. That'll do the\nmath problem even shown its work for\nyou. And it doesn't matter if the\nquestion is typed out or handwritten. It\nworks on both. Yeah, the future is\ncrazy. Of course, using it that way we\ncall cheating. But to them, why wouldn't\nyou? If you have this technology that\nnot only can but will be doing so much\nof this for you, for us, for the\neconomy, why are we doing any of this at\nall? And this intersects with an anxiety\nI have as a parent of a 3 and a\n6-year-old. I don't know what the\neconomy, what society is going to want\nfrom them in 16 or 20 years. And if I\ndon't know what it's going to want from\nthem, what it's going to reward in them,\nhow do I know how they should be\neducated? How do I know if the education\nI am creating for them is doing a good\njob? How do I know if I'm failing them?\nThe purpose of education in schools is\nprofoundly shaken to its core. My guest\ntoday is Rebecca Winthrop. She's the\ndirector of the Center for Universal\nEducation at the Brookings Institute.\nHer latest book co-authored with Jenny\nAnderson is The Disengaged Teen: Helping\nKids Learn Better, Feel Better, and Live\nBetter. As long as my email esc.com.\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\nRebecca Winthrop, welcome to the show.\nLovely to be here, Ezra. I'm a three and\na six-year-old. I feel like I cannot\npredict with\nAI what it is society will want or\nreward from them in 15 16 years which\nmakes this question in the interim how\nshould they be educated what should they\nbe educated towards feel really\nuncertain to me my confidence that the\nschools are set up now for the world\nthey are going to graduate into is very\nvery low so you study education you've\nbeen thinking a lot about education and\nAI. What advice would you give me? So\napproximately a third of kids are deeply\nengaged. Twothirds of the kids are not.\nSo we need to have learning experiences\nthat motivate kids to dig in and engage\nand be excited to learn.\nSo when friends or relatives ask me the\nsame\nquestion, I usually say, look, we have\nto think about three parts to the\nanswer. Why do you want your kids to be\neducated? What is the purpose of\neducation? Because actually now that we\nhave AI that can write essays and pass\nthe bar exam and do AP exams just as\ngood or better than kids, we have to\nreally rethink the purpose of education.\nThe second thing we have to think about\nis how kids learn and we know a lot\nabout that. And the third thing is what\nthey should learn like what's the\ncontent? What are the skills? People\nalways think of education as sort of a\ntransactional transmission of knowledge,\nwhich is one important piece of it, but\nit is actually so much more than that.\nLearning to live with other people,\nlearning to know yourself, and\ndeveloping the flexible competencies to\nbe able to navigate a world of\nuncertainty. Those are kind of the the\nwise for me. But, you know, I might ask\nyou, what what are your hopes and dreams\nfor your kids under the Y before we get\nto the details of the skills? Well, I\nhave a lot of hopes and dreams for my\nkids. I would like them to live happy,\nfulfilling\nlives, I think I'm not\nnaive. And certainly in my\nlifetime, the implicit\npurpose of education, the way we say to\nourselves, did this kid's education work\nout is do they get a good job, right?\nThat's really what we're, you know,\npointing the arrow towards, right? The\nfact that maybe developed their\nfaculties as a human being, the fact\nthat maybe they learned things that were\nbeautiful or fascinating, that's all\ngreat. But if they do all that and they\ndon't get a good job, then we failed\nthem. And if they do none of that, but\nthey do get a good\njob, then we succeeded. So I think\nthat's been the reality of\neducation. But I also think that reality\nrelies a little bit on an economy,\nright, in which we've asked people to\nact very often as machines of a kind.\nAnd now we've created these machines\nthat can act or mimic as people of a\nkind. And so now the whole transaction\nis being thrown into some chaos. The\nskills that I think are going to be most\nimportant are how motivated and engaged\nkids are to be able to learn new things.\nThat is maybe one of the most important\nskills in a time of uncertainty that\nthey are go-getters. They're going to be\nwayfinders. things are going to shift\nand change and they're going to be able\nto navigate and constantly learn new\nthings and be excited to learn new\nthings because when kids are motivated\num that that's actually a huge uh\npredictor of how they do. And we're\ngoing to want kids absolutely to know\nenough content so that they can be a\njudge of what is real and what is fake.\nUm, but we're also going to want them to\nhave experiences where they're learning\nand testing how to come up with creative\nnew solutions to to things, which is not\nreally what traditional public education\nhas been about. I think sometimes about\nthis distinction\nbetween education as a a\nvirtue and education is something that\nis instrumental. Education is training.\nRight?\nstudying the classics was important not\nbecause it made it likelier that you got\ninto law school, right? But because it\ndeepened your appreciation of beauty. It\ndeepened your capacities as a human\nbeing. And I think for reasons that make\na lot of sense in many ways, we drifted\naway from that. And I don't know that\nyou build a society off of people just,\nyou know, enjoying what they're\nstudying. And at the same time, I worry\nnow we have pulled people into a\nconveyor belt that when they get to the\nother side of it, there's not going to\nbe that much there. And I don't even\nthink you need to imagine AI for that.\nThat's already happening to a lot of\npeople. I think one reason you see a lot\nof anger among young people today is\nthat the the deal often doesn't come\nthrough. You do all the\nextracurriculars,\nyou get your good grades, you show up on\ntime, and then you graduate college and\nthe good jobs and the interesting life\nyou were promised just aren't\nthere. And so there's something there\nthat feels like it is getting thrown\ninto question if we don't know what the\nfuture's going to ask of us. How can we\nbe instrumental in the way we train\npeople for it?\nWe can't be super\ninstrumental. So we have to come up with\na new plan. I mean we did not know\ncollectively us the world that we would\nhave generative AI that could basically\nwrite every you know seventh grade essay\nor college essay to get into university\nor you know the whole host of\nexams that are being administered um and\nare being passed by AI just as well or\nbetter than kids. So we have to come up\nwith a new plan. Like that is not the\nplan for success. And we need to have\nkids build\nthat muscle of doing hard things because\nI worry greatly that AI will basically\nmake a frictionless world for young\npeople. It's great for me. I'm loving\ngenerative AI, but I have had several\ndecades of brain development um where I\nknow how to do hard things. So, but kids\nare developing their brains. They're\nliterally being neurobiologically wired\nfor how to attend, how to focus, how to\ntry, how to connect ideas, how to relate\nto other people. And all of those are\nare not easy things. And I want to push\nback on something you said. You said, \"I\ndon't know if kids just enjoy what\nthey're\nlearning. It's going to help or people\nare really going to benefit from that.\"\nEngagement is very powerful. It's\nbasically how motivated you are to um to\nreally dig in and learn. And it relates\nto what you do. Do you show up? Do you\nparticipate? Do you do your homework? It\nrelates to how you feel. Do you find\nschool interesting? Um, is it exciting?\nDo you feel you belong at school? It\nrelates to how you think. Are you\ncognitively engaged? Are you uh looking\nat what you learn in one class, applying\nit to what it might mean in your real in\nyour life outside or other classes? Uh,\nand it's also how proactive you are\nabout your learning. And all those\ndimensions really work together in\neducation. And it's a very powerful um\nuh construct to predict better\nachievement, better grades, better\nmental health, more enrollment in\ncollege, better understanding of content\num and lots of other benefits to boot.\nSo you have in in your book these four\nmodes of engagement. Do you want to talk\nthrough them? Absolutely. So we found\nafter three years of research that kids\nengage in four different ways. They're\npassenger mode, kids are coasting.\nAchiever mode, they're trying to get\nperfect\noutcomes. Resistor mode, they're\navoiding and disrupting. And explorer\nmode is when they really love what\nthey're learning and they dig in and\nthey're super proactive. So that's the\nhighlevel framework. What what part do\nyou want to dig in on? Well, why don't\nyou go go through them? I I think\npassenger mode is particularly\ninteresting here. So why don't we start\nthere?\nSo passenger mode\nis difficult to spot\noften for parents and sometimes teachers\nbecause many kids in passenger mode get\nreally good grades but are just bored to\ntears. They show up to school, they do\nthe homework, they have dropped out of\nlearning. So passenger mode is when kids\nare really coasting doing the bare\nminimum. Some signs of this are your kid\ncomes home and they do their homework as\nfast as possible. Another sign is that\nthey say, \"Oh, school's boring. It's\njust boring. I learn nothing.\" Kids are\nin passenger mode because school is\nactually too easy for them. We talked to\nso many kids who said, \"Look, I you\nknow, I'm in in class and the teacher is\ngoing going over the math homework from\nyesterday and I got everyone right and I\nknow the answers and it's 45 minutes of\nthat and and I understand the kids who\ndon't get it. they need the help but you\nknow I'm going to shop online or you\nknow I have kids who say well I got the\nhomework home and I know all I know how\nto do this stuff so I just put in chat\nGPT and it did my problem set for me and\nthen I you know turn it in. So that's\nwhen it's too too easy. Another version\nof why kids get into passenger mode is\nwhen it's too hard. School is too hard.\nYou could have a neurode divergent kid.\nkids don't feel um you know they belong\nand so they're not tuning in. Um they've\nmissed certain pieces of skill sets that\nthey really need. Knowledge and\neducation is cumulative in many ways um\nand they get kind of overwhelmed and\nthey need particular special attention.\nSo that's kind of what's going on in\npassenger mode. Well, one reason I\nwanted to start in passenger mode is\nthat when I think about ways\nAI probably is now but can be very\nharmful, it's the connection with that\nmode because in passenger mode, what you\nwant to do and and many of us have done\npassenger mode at work and many of us\nhave done it at school. In some ways,\npassenger mode was what I aspired to be\nat school. I just wasn't able to achieve\nit. But you're reading something you\nthink is boring. You're reading\nsomething you don't want to be reading.\nBut you want to get a good grade. So\nmaybe at an earlier point you would buy\nthe spark notes, right? But now you just\nhave Chad GPT summarize it. And more\nthan that, you can have Chachi PT write\nthe essay. Kids are getting better at\ntelling Chachi, no, you actually wrote\ntoo good of an essay. Like dumb it down\na little bit. that you you've basically\nhired your\nown like fill-in student\nwho can help you\ncoast and that will help you get if\nyou're able to do it a jointly enough\ndecent grades but also whatever meta\nskills forget the knowledge whatever\nmeta-kills are being taught how to read\na book how to write an essay you're not\nactually learning\nthem and that's I think when people\nthink educationally about\nAI, a bit of the fear and and something\nthat I believe everybody believes is\nhappening now. So So how do you think\nabout that interaction?\nI think you're 100% right. I've talked\nto kids all all over the country. I've\nseen lots of incidents or cases of\nhighly motivated, highly engaged kids\nwho are using AI really well. Um they'll\nwrite the paper themselves. They'll go\nin and use AI for research and help them\ncopy\nedit. They're doing the thinking and\nthey've lined up the evidence to create\na thesis and they've presented it in\nlogical order on their own. And that is\nthe art of thinking. And that's why we\nassign seventh graders to write essays\nor 10th graders to write essays. It's\nnot that they're going to create, you\nknow, incredible works of art. It's to\ntrain them how to think logically and\nhow to think in steps and that is a core\ncomponent of critical thinking. So as\nlong as kids are mastering that and the\nAI is helping that's a good use but a\nlot of kids are using it to do exactly\nlike you said shortcut the assignments.\nSo, an an example, one kid I talked to\nsaid, um, well, you know, this a high\nschool kid for my essay, I break the um\nprompt into three parts. I run it in\nthrough three different generative AI\nmodels. I put it together. I run it\nthrough three anti- plagiarism checkers\nand then I turn it in. Another kid said,\n\"Yeah, I do it. I I run it through chat\nGPT and then I run it through an AI\nhumanizer, which goes in and puts typos\nin and makes it, you know, your kids are\ngetting good at something. I'm not sure\nwhat we want them getting good at, but\nthey're getting good at something. Kids\nwill find a way no matter what. Kids\nwill find a way. We cannot out maneuver\nthem with technology. So, so the first\nresponse when Gen AI came in was ban it,\nblock it, get anti-ag plagiarism\ncheckers in, which are which are bad by\nthe way. Like I talked to one kid who\nshowed me he had this essay um and the\nplagiarism checker flagged 40% of it and\nhe changed two words and then it went\naway. It was all he's all good. So, you\nknow, it is worrisome. So, what we need\nto do is shift what we're doing in our\nteaching and learning experiences. I\nhave very personally complicated\nfeelings on this on on the question of\nAI and education, just question of\neducation\ngenerally. I hated school. Hated it. Did\nterribly in it. Starting in middle\nschool, going through high school,\nfailed classes. It just found the whole\nthing impenetrable.\nAnd not because I wasn't smart, not\nbecause I wasn't interested even in\nthings related to it, just somehow the\nwhole construct didn't work for me. And\nI couldn't make it work for me. It\nwasn't exactly that I was bored. I I I\nI think today I probably could have\nmusled through it, but for whatever\nreason then I couldn't, but I was\nvoracious outside of school. I spent\nthree or four nights a week at Barnes &\nNoble. I loved reading deeply into\nthings that that I was interested in.\nAnd I've related the story before and\none of the the sort of reactions I get\nis well you should really\nthen recognize the way school fails kids\nand in a way I do but it's just not\nobvious to me at all that school should\nbe tuned for me. Like one thing that I\nrecognize as somebody who studies\nbureaucracies is that if you just think\nof US public education to say nothing of\nalso private education to say nothing of\nglobal\neducation it's educating a lot of\nkids and its ability to tune itself to\nevery kid is going to be pretty modest\nand what kids need is different but\nsomehow you have to be orienting towards\nsomething that works for most of them\neven if you're not sure how to make it\nwork for all of them. I'm I'm curious\nhow you think about that. I am not sure\nI agree. I think you I agree with\nseveral things. One, you are not alone.\nThere are many many kids who currently\ntoday are going through the system and\nfeel like you. two, I agree with you\nthat as sort of a\nbureaucratic\nsystem that is actually quite miraculous\nif you think about it. Like in every\ncommunity across our\ncountry, kids as young as 3 to 18 at the\nsame time of day are getting themselves\nto a place Monday through Friday for a\ncertain amount of days in the year. I\nmean, that is a that is a organizational\nfeat. And the thing I don't agree with\nis that once you're\nthere, you just have to design for the\nmean and the average. I think there's\nlots of examples AC that are relatively\nbig scale that or at least not just one,\nyou know, little school in a corner by\none fabulous, you know, homespun teacher\nthat do things differently. And I think\nit actually just gets down to how we\norchestrate teaching and learning\nexperiences. Give me one of those\nexamples. One of those examples of a\nschooling system able to educate in a\npersonalized\nway at\nscale that seems to you to be\nreplicable. I'll give you a couple. So\nthere's an example of schools in North\nDakota that have created studios for\ntheir adolescence. And what are studios?\nThey are self-created classes that a\nstudent can\num\ndesign and so and they have to tell you\nor tell the teacher what standards\nthey're meeting. I'll give you an\nexample. We have um a great character in\nthe book I've done with Jenny Anderson,\nthe disengaged teen, uh named um Kia,\nand she was totally disengaged, doom\nscrolling, and in middle school, and\nthen these studios showed up. She got\nsuper into it because she was learning\num history and science, and she decided\nto design an escape room. and she had to\nlist out for herself, these are the\nstandards I'm meeting for whatever grade\nshe was in, 10th grade, I think, uh,\nhistory and science. And she did an\nescape room around the assassination of\nAbraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. But\nshe had to design this escape room that\nturned her on like nobody else. Um, and\nthat she she got super excited and she\ndid several of those and then and then\nshe actually said she was so motivated\nshe went back to sort of normal classes.\nThey're doing that across the district.\nThat's one small example. There's other\nexamples of schools that um you know do\nreally we're talking about AI do sort of\ntechbased\nuh education on core subjects for a\ncouple hours a day, math, science,\nreading, social studies, and then for\nthe rest of the day they are doing\nprojects together on whatever it may be\nthat they so decide. And there's a\ncurriculum, there's things you know the\nteachers want them to learn. It's not a\nevery kid do whatever you want. Um, but\nthat's super motivating. There's no\nreason that we couldn't do that with the\nexisting staff and people and school\nbuildings and infrastructure. We just\nhave to have the willpower to to decide\nto do things differently. I want to zoom\nin on something in that story, which is\nthat when the the student you brought up\nfound the thing that lit her up, she was\nthen able to to to do better in in all\nthe other classes that maybe\ndidn't. This was a little bit of my own\nexperience of life. For me, it was\npolitical blogging of all things, which\nI found as a freshman in college.\nAnd once I I\nactivated, then I became much better at\ndoing things that I didn't want to do or\ndidn't exactly see the point of in even\nunrelated fields. I love that. So you\nstarted political blogging and then what\nhappened? I think the way you what would\nhave been the the conventional line on\nme from the adults who knew me was smart\nkid can't get it together, right? Just\ncan't seem to get the homework in,\nright? can't seem to do things he's not\nthat interested in doing and can't even\nseem to do the things he is interested\nin doing in a way that fits what we want\nfrom him. I read every book in English\nclass and I enjoyed doing the essays and\nI'm a good writer. I think I'm willing\nto say that at this point in my life. I\nthink you're allowed. And I still did\nbadly on the essays\num because it wasn't what they wanted\nfor me in some way or another. Right.\nAnd over time, I just don't have that ex\nI mean, that was the broad experience of\nmy life that I couldn't fit what I did\nto what the world wanted for me, right?\nAnd now I'm just much better at doing\nthat in a in in ways that are not\nrelated to my my core set of interests.\nI'm not trying to overextrapulate my\nexperience. It's actually important to\nme not to overextrapulate my experience.\nBut something I've seen you talk about\nis this this quality of when students\nfind the teacher, find the subject, find\nthe\napproach that activates\nthem that all of a sudden the things\nthat are not that activating to them\nbecome become easier that there is a a\nsort of lock in a key dynamic. There is\nand this is something we talk about\naround finding your\nspark. Kids need to find their spark and\nit they may have many sparks and their\nsparks may change but when kids find\ntheir spark for Kia it was this idea of\ndoing an escape room around historical\nresidential assassinations. She got\nexcited. Other students they find sparks\nin other places. Uh, one of the\ncharacters in our book, Samir,\nabsolutely loved local politics and dove\nin getting himself on the school board\nultimately in high school. Another\nstudent, Matteo, um, was super excited\nand turned on by robotics and that's\nwhat really turned him around. And when\nyou're motivated, this internal drive,\nit makes you engage more, you lean in\nmore, you enjoy it more. There's a\nvirtuous upward cycle. And there's lots\nof evidence to show that it often spills\nover. So Kia talks about um doing these\nstudios for a couple years which really\nhelped her re-engage and care about\nschool. Uh and then she went back and\ndid some um high school college credit\ncourses which were very um sort of you\nknow traditional structure. and she said\nshe didn't love the structure, but she\nhad enough motivation to figure out how\nto bend the class to her interests. So,\nthat's the best case scenario. It\ndoesn't always spill over automatically.\nWhat you talked about when you said you\nenjoyed it, you loved it, you loved\nEnglish, but you didn't give the\nteachers what they want. It's probably\nbecause you were a total explorer. And\nwe do not reward engaging in school\nuh in a in a way that supports explorers\nin general. uh and that is what we have\nto change. So, so then this gets to the\nAI optimist case and I take the AI\noptimist case as something like\nthis. It's pretty hard to do\npersonalized learning even if you have\nuh examples that that you've seen work\nbecause you have one teacher, it's a\nclassroom of 20 30 kids oftent\ntimes. But AI makes this completely\ndifferent. AI gives you more tutors than\nthere are children. It allows you to\nhave tutors who adapt to that kid's\nindividual learning style in any way you\nwanted to, in any way they wanted to. If\nthis kid is a visual learner, it can do\nvisual learning. If pop quizzes are\nhelpful for them, they can do pop\nquizzes. It can turn it into a podcast\nthey listen to. If you, you know, are\nare more audio\nfocused, everything can be turned into a\npoem if you absorb information better\nthrough the sonnet form. That as we get\nbetter at this and as we build these\nsystems and tune them better, although\nthey're already pretty capable here,\nthat our ability to personalize\neducation using artificial intelligence\nas tutors, will be like nothing ever\nseen before in human history. It's a\ncomplete quantum leap in educational\npossibility.\nAnd as such, it allows you to bring\nevery child into their educational\nutopia, whatever that is, to spark them,\nto turn them on, to make them into an\nexplorer. How do you feel about that\nmore utopic vision?\nI think we're on the same page. We\nschools exist. They're important.\nThey're important for many reasons. We\nneed to change what we do inside of\nthem, particularly because of Gen AI,\nand we need to do it quickly. um in\naddition to I would say you know\nregulating Genai so it isn't so\nmassively in in students and young\npeople's hands without being designed\nfor that purpose. I would say those are\nthe two big things we need to do. But I\ndon't think our goal inside schools when\nwe're educating young people is to have\na 100% personalized learning journey for\nevery kid. What I think you're talking\nabout is actually the ability for Genai\nto help teachers, which I think is very\nreal. I think there's a big difference\nand we need to make a big distinction\nbetween AI supporting educators in doing\nwhat they do versus going direct to\nyoung people. Well, well, let me push\nyou on this for a second before you go\nhere because if I'm taking the position\nof the AI optimist, what I'd say is no,\nI'm not saying that. I'm saying the AI\nwill be better than the teachers. Better\nat what? If we are saying that AI is\ngoing to be better than the median for\nmany people at many kinds of work, why\nwould we not assume that this system we\nwill be able to build in six years given\nhow fast these things are developing\nwon't per kid be better than the\nteacher? I am not saying I believe this,\nbut I want to make you argue. No, you're\npushing on it. I get the AI optimist.\nBut the question is better at what? So\nteachers do many many things. kids learn\nin relationships with other humans.\nWe've evolved to do that. I do not think\nthat we will go away from that or we may\ngo away and then we'll be like, \"Oh my\ngod, that was a huge mistake.\" And 10\nyears later go back. So there's a\nquestion around skill development and\nknowledge transmission. That is one\nthing a teacher does and I think that's\nwhat you're talking about. That is an\narea where I think\ntechnology can be good. Can be really\ngood. So, and and actually we see it\neven without generative AI. There's\nadaptive learning software, you know,\nthat helps kids really, you know, learn\nto read. Um, which is incredibly\nhelpful, especially if you have access\ngaps, you don't have good teachers, you\nhave large classes, you have substitute\nteachers that aren't trained on on how\nto teach kids to read. So that\ncomplemented with things that motivate\nkids, get them excited and see the\nrelevance of what they're doing, which\nis often in person could be a great\ncould be a great thing to do inside the\nclassroom. We we see private schools\ndoing that. There's a a group of schools\nthat I have not visited and I don't know\num up close, but alpha schools are doing\nthis. They do and they've been doing it\nfor 10 years actually pre- Genai. They\ndo a couple couple hours of sort of\nadaptive learning on key academic\nsubjects and then the rest of the time\num kids are working together to build\nbridges or learn about financial\nliteracy or play sports or identify a\npassion that they want to go learn about\nin their community. It's together. It's\nalone. What we don't want to do is bring\nAI in and have every kid sitting in\nfront of a AI tutor alone at their desk\nfor eight hours a day. that that's not\nthe future that is gonna help our kids.\nI guess another way you might think\nabout it is that this changes the job of\nthe teacher quite substantially.\nAbsolutely.\nSo, and I will say I think I don't\nbelieve what I'm about to say. So, I\ndon't want to get yelled at by everybody\nfor for every take I'm not talking to\nyou. I'm talking to my beloved audience.\nUm my beloved audience. Fair enough. Uh\nbut one thing I've observed is that it\nseems to me that where AI is going to\npush is towards the skills of the\nmanager, the editor, the\nsupervisor, the fact checker in a way\nand often away from the skills which are\nright now more numerous and needed in\nmore numerous quantities of the worker,\nof the writer, of in this case maybe the\nteacher. So, if you think about that\nthat world that you were just describing\nas the one we don't want a second ago\nwhere you have 25 kids in a class,\nthey're all staring at a screen. They're\nall working with an individualized AI\ntutor, right? You could imagine a world\nif you think about every one of those\nscreens as a junior teacher, as an\nindividual tutor, that there's some\nmaster teacher in the room who the kids\ncan go talk to, who can like be pulled\nin to sort of oversee the learning to\nreshape what's happening. There is\ntesting there. There there are things\nthat are trying to help us evaluate how\nthe kids are doing. But the teacher\nwho's already managing a classroom of\nstudents is now also in a way managing a\nclassroom of helpers of tutors. I think\nthat would be the kind of vision you\nwould hear from the more AI pill among\nus.\nRight? The role of the teacher in\ntraditional public schools is damn near\nimpossible. Honestly, they have to\nmaster a certain subject. They have to\nget kids to grade level. So, if you have\nand usually we have a wide difference of\ngrade levels in school between three and\nfour different grade levels. So, they've\ngot to differentiate and figure out who\nneeds what. The bored kid who's the\npassenger, the struggling kid who's also\nthe passenger, both of them silent and\nquiet and you don't even know. Um, and\nthey've got to manage classroom\ndynamics. Like kids have to not, you\nknow, hit each other or disrupt each\nother or ruin the furniture. Um, and\nthey have to increasingly be social\nworkers. Kids are not doing well. Lots\nof mental health problems. They've got\nto spot that. They've got to help it.\nThey also have to be relationship\nmanagers. They've got to work with\nparents, etc. So, it's very hard for one\nteacher to do this all. Absolutely. I\nthink the wave of the future is a\ndifferent model where you have multiple\npeople and one of those could be an AI\ntutor helping support our kids growth\nand development.\nThe interaction with\nAI can help with skill development,\nknowledge acquisition, but that is one\nslice of what happens in a classroom and\nit is one slice of what it really means\nfor kids to be educated. Kids are\nlearning all sorts of things in a\nclassroom. They're learning how to\nself-regulate emotions in a group.\nThey're learning how to understand\ndifferent perspectives from kids who are\ndifferent from themselves. They're\nthey're learning, you know, how to ask\nfor help when they need it. There's a\nwhole bunch of things that kids are kids\nare learning that is much more personto\nperson that we want to maintain, I would\nargue. Here's where I actually am.\nI think we've just been going through a\ncatastrophic\nexperiment with screens and children and\nright now I think we are starting to\nfigure out that this was a bad idea and\nschools are banning\nphones. My sense is that they are not\nrelying very much on laptops and iPads.\nThere's a big vogue for a while of every\nkid gets their own uh uh laptop or\ntablet. I think that's beginning to go\naway if I'm reading the the tea leaves\nof this, right? And so I feel a bit\nbetter about that as a parent of young\nkids. I really feel badly for the\nparents whose\nkids have been navigating this over the\npast 10 or 15 10 years, let's call\nit. And right now I see AI coming and I\ndon't think we understand it at all. I\ndon't think we understand how to teach\nwith it. I don't think the studies we're\ndoing right now are good studies yet.\nThere are too many other effects we're\nnot going to be measuring. I think\nthere's the the sort of narrow thing\nthat a program does and then what it\ndoes for a kid to be staring at a screen\nall the time in a a deeper way. I\nbelieve human beings are\nembodied. And if you made me choose\nbetween sending my kids to a school that\nhas no screens at all and one that is\ntrying the latest in AI technology, I\nwould send them to school with no\nscreens at all in a\nsecond. But we're going to be working\nthrough this somehow. And what scares\nme, putting aside what world my kids\ngraduate into, is them moving into\nschools at the exact time that they\ndon't know what the hell to do with this\ntechnology. And they're about to try a\nlot of things that don't work and\nprobably try it\nbadly. And I wonder as somebody who's\ntracked this, what you think the\nlessons of what I consider at least the\nscreens and phones\ndebacle of the 2010s or the\n2000s have been. I agree with you 100%.\nIt was a massive uncontrolled experiment\nand our kids were the guinea pigs. We\njust had a wait andsee approach. We\ncannot take a wait and see approach\nagain. And I think that there's lots of\nlessons. I would say first off, do\nnot use generative AI unless you really\nknow what you're using it for. there is\na a a real sense of\nFOMO among educators, parents, young\npeople even that there's this thing\nhappening out there and I I should use\nit because it's the newest thing. I saw\nthat with uh groups who were working on\nstudent well-being and they um had done\nteacher training around um well-being\ncurriculum for teachers and they said,\n\"Oh, we need to train parents how to do\nit.\" So, their idea was let's use Genai.\nIt'll be great because parents also, you\nknow, do need to reinforce\nwell-being messages that teachers are\ngiving in school, which is true. And\nwhat we'll do is we'll create an app.\nAnd so this is what they had suggested.\nEzra, imagine you sitting down around\nthe dinner table. You pull up your phone\nand you have an app and your kids have\ntheir phone and you say, \"Okay, how are\nyou feeling today?\" And um you know,\nyou're looking at your phone and they're\ntelling you how they feel. And then you\nclick through and ask, you know, why why\nare you feeling that way? Like mediated\nthrough a phone. It's crazy. It's crazy.\nLike we've lost our mind like that. We\nneed AI to talk to our kids. So, you\nknow, if you don't need if there's not a\nreal problem you're trying to solve,\ndon't use it is number one. Number two,\nany I really do believe this, any\ncompany that wants to work with kids in\nschools should be a benefit corporation\nbecause legally you have a lot of\ncompanies who are creating perhaps\nreally good stuff if used well that they\nhave to maximize profits. They can't\nmaximize social benefit and well-being.\nWell, one thing that worries me is the\nway in which this might maybe already\nhas been widen the\ninequality between parents who can pay\nfor private schools and parents who\ncan't. And what I mean by that is that\nprivate schools can just adapt more\nquickly. They are not dealing with they\ndon't have to go through legislatures\nand have the boards and they they're\nthey're just a little bit more\nindependent. they can take the screens\nout, they can put them in, they can\nlimit what comes in. Whereas the public\nschool systems tend to be somewhat more\nslowmoving. Um, I just knew living out\nin the Bay Area, a lot of tech people\nwho were paying money to send their kids\nto private schools that had banned the\nproducts they made starting many years\nago and the rest of everybody were\nsending them to public schools that had\nnot done that. And when things are very\nvery fast moving, being able to be fast\nmoving is really important. So somebody\nwho cares a lot about public\neducation, what should the orientation\nof the public schools be? How do they\nsort of not seem to parents who think\nthere's something that their kids should\nbe getting out of this? Don't their kids\nneed to know how to use AI? Um, so\nthey're going to need to attract parents\non on that level, but\nalso how do they not end up flatfooted\nif this is turning out to be a disaster?\nThis is a really tricky question and you\nyou point on something that is a real\nissue which is around the deep equity\nissues that have already emerged. So\nthink about the schools that ban AI for\na kid who has no access to AI at\nhome versus a kid who goes home and has\nfull access to all the AI tools. That\nright there is a huge cleavage in our\ncountry. It also um there's a huge\nequity gap in terms of\nlanguage. Large language models work off\nof language that is written down.\nThere's a lot of languages that aren't\nwritten down that much. They have very\nlittle written down. And so there you're\nseeing a global gap across the globe um\nbetween sort of African and indigenous\nlanguages or um and communities versus\nEnglish speakaking or other large\nlanguages. So there is a equity is a is\na huge one. Your question about sort of\npublic versus private. I would say to\npublic education systems do do not have\nFOMO because that is what the gut\ninstinct is when a new technology comes.\nI'm missing out. I have a fear of\nmissing out and I need to adopt it and I\nI see this. So don't have FOMO. Don't\nuse it unless it's a real problem you\nwant to solve. Do give it to the adults\nin the school building. Give it to\nteachers. Have them use it and figure\nout how it will help them today. Then\ngive it to sort of really in, you know,\nnovel school leaders to think about how\nthey could maybe restructure the\nteaching and learning experiences. What\nare the things that um AI can do?\nThere's a so much that um AI could\nactually do to help make public schools\nwork better. Bus schedules, calendaring,\nschool meals, cafeteria. I mean, you\nknow, assessment input. There's so much\ntime that could be really freed up. Let\nme try to sharpen the FOMO argument or\nthe argument that will be used to give\npeople FOMO. The argument goes something\nlike this. If AI is a very potent\ntechnology that's going to be integrated\ninto virtually everything in the future,\nnot literally everything, but but quite\na lot, then not just your literacy, but\nyour competency in it becomes paramount.\nYou're not going to be replaced by an\nAI. You're going to be replaced by a\nperson who knows how to use\nAI. And so what you need to learn is to\nuse the AI. You need to learn how to\nmanage it, how to prompt it, a sense of\nwhat it can and can't do. And there's no\nway to do that other than relentless\nfamiliarity and experimentation and\nexposure.\nAnd so a kid who goes to some lite\nschool or when they're young the toys\nare made out of wood and when they're\nolder the books are all printed on paper\nand there's not a geni in\nsight is going to lose out and it will\nbe like having not taught them\nmathematics right or having not taught\nthem how to drive or something of that\nor how to type right how do you take\nthat argument\nI think it is 50% % right and I think\nthe 50% depends on the age of the child.\nI absolutely 100% think you should send\nyour kids to the Waldorf school with a\nwood blocks and um when they're young.\nYou know, we know that kids um early\nchildhood the more screen time they have\nthe less language acquisition they have.\nWe know that, you know, babies when\nyou're um when infants are learning uh\nlanguage, they learn a lot of language\nfrom human to human contact. And when if\nyou put the same\nsentences on a on a screen, they don't\nlearn it. Our neurobiology is not going\nto change in, you know, five years. So\nwe have to work with that's the only\nconfines I think we really have to work\nwithin everything else I think we can\nreimagine but it's true that when kids\nget\nolder you do want to teach AI literacy\nwhen kids understand this is true for\nsocial media too when kids sort of learn\nabout oh these big companies are um you\nknow trying to addict me they're I I'm\ndoing it for free but I get um you know\nwith my attention and uh staying on it\nlonger is how they make money. You get\nyou tell that to teenagers actually\nthere's been great research on this and\nthey get pissed off. I think we need to\ndo the same with AI literacy like this\nis how it works. It's not some magical\nthing. It's not another human being. So\nwhen kids get older, we need to teach\nthem about that and then they need when\nthey get older they need to start\nplaying with it. Playing with it, using\nit. But my huge caveat is\nwith AI that is designed for kids. Right\nnow there is a spring fling race by the\nlarge AI\nlabs to get students to sign up. You've\ngot chat\nGPT giving two months free of of GPT\nplus. Then you got XAI come in two\nmonths free for Super Grock and then\nGoogle. um not to be outdone is like\nwell you can get a month you can get a\nyear free and I'll give you two\nterabytes of storage and these are\nlargely um for college students and\nGoogle just made Gemini available um for\nfor kids through parents with family\nplan and they are\nracing to get allegiance of young kids.\nThis is terrible because those products\nare not designed for children and for\nlearning. I guess then there to go back\nto your equity\npoint, there's the argument from the\nopposite direction in\nequity, which is that it is the kids\nwith the least access to all kinds of\nenrichment materials to to tutors. I\nmean, we we know what rich kids in urban\ncenters get and then what you're getting\nI mean, you know, in parts of America\nthat are rural and don't yet have\nbroadband or don't have wide access to\nbroadband to say nothing of, you know, a\nkid in Nigeria um in rural Nigeria. That\nthat is\nwhere at least a well\nststructured Genai tutor might be able\nto make a difference really fast. You've\ntalked a bit about a study uh in\nNigeria that I never quite know how to\nhow seriously to take these studies yet.\nUm but but why don't you say what it\nwhat it did and what it found?\nSo I think that AI has real potential\nfor very specific use cases particularly\naround access gaps and in Nigeria\nwhat was done was after school twice a\nweek um an AI tutor helped kids learn\nEnglish and it was for 6 weeks which is\nnot long it was June July I think it was\na randomized control trial we're still\nwaiting for all the evidence to come\nthrough but three standard deviations\nwhich is pretty good equivalent to maybe\ntwo years of average sort of English\nlearning. And you know, we see that\ndifference with other technologies too.\nIt doesn't have to be Gen AI. It can be\nrule-based AI. It could be predictive\nAI. We've seen sort of similar benefits\nfor example in Malawi teaching literacy\nand numeracy to kids with offline\ntablets um where teachers have maybe 80\nto 100 kids in a class and each kid is\nhaving sort of a personalized adaptive\nlearning experience that is hugely\nbeneficial as well. So that's one use\ncase. Another use case that I think is\nreally great is um neurode divergent\nkids. Super helpful. Um there's all\nsorts of kids um that have different\nlearning differences that struggle in\nschool, don't have access to the\nspecialists that they need that would\nbenefit greatly from, you know, being in\na classroom where they could have a\nlittle assistant to help them navigate.\nUm we I see my my youngest son has\ndyslexia and they the sort of read and\nwrite text to speech speech to text has\nbeen gamechanging for him. There's also\nuse cases here in the US. Do you see AI\nbeing used and experimented around\nsupporting wellness advisors who kind of\nfill the gap for school counselors in\nrural school districts for example where\nthey don't have school counselors which\nis actually a an actual person but AI is\nboosting that person's ability um to\nhave a helpful conversation with a kid\nand it's bringing through tech a mental\nhealth resource into a community that\ndidn't have one. So there's lots of use\ncases actually if done well contained\nwell designed well and we have adult you\nknow we humans have our hand on the\nsteering wheel. Ethan Mollik who's a an\nAI expert he's got this idea that has\nbeen influential for me about the best\navailable human is AI better for you in\na certain purpose not than the best\nhuman but the best human available to\nyou at a given moment. Exactly. So yes,\nhaving a professional excellent editor\nlike my editor at the New York Times\nwould be better, but most people don't\nhave that available. So AI is a better\nthan the best available editor to them.\nThere's a lot more demand for therapy\nthan there are therapists. So often\ntimes AI is, you know, practically where\nit's going. Even for me, sometimes it's\na better therapist than the best\navailable therapist I have uh available\nat a given moment. It certainly seems\nplausibly true in education, too. Uh\nthere's all kinds of times when you are\nconfused by what you are reading, what\nyou are learning. Yep. And you're in a\nbig class and it's embarrassing to ask\n55 questions or there's even time to ask\n55 questions and you don't want to seem\nstupid. But if you could contain the\nsystem\nsomehow and that seems more plausible\nhere where there's a fundamental prompt\nat the core of them, right? Then you\nknow if we got that right uh it it you\nknow in a lot of these use cases it\ncould be really absolutely and the key\nis what you said contain the system. We\ncan't sort of just bring commercial tech\ninto our schools and hope it will solve\nthese problems. It has to have guard\nrails. We have to make sure that the\ndata that's it's being trained on is\nlegit and not going to create harmful\nprompts for kids. We've seen terrible\nthings with commercial um AI companions\nwith young young people, you know,\ndeveloping relationships and being, you\nknow, really manipulated emotionally.\nBut you can put guard rails. It's\ntotally possible. Um it's just where who\nwhat the frankly it gets back to the the\nincentives. It gets back to the business\nmodel. Um and which is where you you\nknow regulation and government could and\nshould step in. Um, so yes, if contained\nis the question. So then let me ask you\nabout the other impulse somebody might\nhave, which is not that you're going to\nbe replaced by somebody who knows how to\nuse AI, but that in a world where we\nhave AIs, the most important thing for\nhuman beings to be is as human as\npossible. And that what we need to do is\nreturn to more classical\neducation. that what we need to do is be\nreading the great books, developing the\nattentional faculties that a lot of data\nand anecdata suggest that even very\nelite students are losing. To read a\nlong book and think about it, to write a\nlong\nessay, to be educated in the way that\nwas considered high civilization\neducation 70 years ago and you might get\nat a St. John's or a U of Chicago or\ncertain private schools today. But\nactually what we should do is retreat\nsomewhat. School should be a place not\nwhere we learn how to partner with\nmachines because the rest of societyy's\ngoing to tell you how to do that. School\nshould be a place where we develop\nspecifically human\nfaculties such that we are capable and\nflexible and\nattentive in moving through a world that\nwe just cannot predict. We 100% want\nkids to have the capacity for deep\nattention. And you're thinking about\nyour own kiddos who are young. And I'm\nthinking about my own teenagers who are\n13 and 16.\nAnd I\nsee the undermining of attentive\nfaculties from when my 16-year-old got\nhis phone. For a long time, he didn't\nwant a phone because I'd been droning on\nand on for years cuz he has me as a\nmother about addiction and opportunity\ncosts and just that, you know, it's okay\nto enjoy it a little bit, but you know,\ncan't sacrifice sleep and physical\nexercise and inperson, you know,\ncommunication. And then he did get his\nphone and he struggles with it and he\nsays, \"Mom, this is really hard.\" Like\nit's eroding his ability to do his\nhomework or to follow follow something\nhe wants to do. The only thing that it\ndoesn't seem to distract him from doing\nis playing the piano because he loves\nplaying the piano. So anything that we\ncan do to actually ensure young people\nare developing the muscle and it's not\njust attention and tension is the entry\npoint. That's the doorway that gets you\nthrough. It's actually reflection and\nmeaning making which is what you get\nfrom deep reading and reading full books\nwhich a lot of young people struggle to\ndo today. You also can get it from other\nmeans. You could get it from long\nsocratic dialogues in community with\ndiverse people over time. But it has to\nbe an experience where you reflect, you\nthink about meaning, you think about\ndifferent\nperspectives and it changes how you see\nthe world. But but what do you think\nabout this idea that school should be a\nrare screen-free\noasis in a child's life? I've sometimes\nimagined a school that you know I could\nsend my kids to. I'm not saying it\nexists just in my head. Yes. where what\nthey do is they go in and you know\nsomebody is watching them and helping\nthem read books and think through math\nand there's long periods and and they\nhave a certain amount of exploratory\ncapacity in that right you can choose\nbetween different books you can but that\nthe idea that maybe one space in their\nlife would just be a place that is\ntrying to encourage in them that\ncapacity for meaning\nfor deep attention, for deep\ncontemplation. It seems to me to be more\nvaluable than it seems to be to other\npeople. To just have a teacher sit there\nand watch kids read for an hour and a\nhalf at a time and then there's a\ndiscussion than to do a lot of what we\ndo in school. And so this idea of\nschools as as explicitly counter to the\ntrends of the moment because they need\nto develop things that the moment will\nnot naturally develop. How do you think\nabout that? I think that's right. I\nactually think if I had to choose for my\nown kids, um, and I do, we would have,\nyou know, a school that has no no\nphones for all the reasons we know. And\nJonathan Height has done a great job on\non, you know, sort of catalyzing that\nmovement here in the US and bringing it\nfrom across the globe to our schools. I\nthink today we should have cell phone\nbands in school, bell to bell. don't\ndon't have it at recess because that's\nwhere you start interacting and playing\nwith kids. And uh I think we should um\nmake school a place where kids can\nactually interact with each other, have\ndevelop humanto human socialization\ncapacities because there is massive\ncommercial tech the minute they leave\nschool that is vying for their attention\nand coming for them. And make sure make\nsure to do some highquality AI literacy.\nAI literacy is way way different than\nusing AI to learn. AI literacy is what\nis this? How was it\nmade? What are the risks? What are the\nbenefits? And let's talk about what how\nour ethics around this new tool and and\nhow to incorporate it into our lives.\nyou know, with an in with an adult\ninstructor talking about how it works\nand what it is. I think that would\nthat's AI literacy and that's important.\nI hope you're right. I I've been in\ngeneral very skeptical of of how much\nliteracy will do. But I guess this goes\nback to I mean there is a question how\nmuch we will do, but your your question\nis will it make a difference? I'm as I'm\nas phone literate as I think you can\nalmost be. I've been writing about this\nfor years. Y I'm functionally extremist\non this\nissue and still the only way for me to\nmodulate my own use to the point I would\nlike to is to use a device that hobbles\nmy phone the brick every time I touch it\nto the RFID chip and if I don't do that\nall the literacy in the world I've known\nJohn height for many many years he's\nbeen on this show I've read the anxious\ngeneration um it doesn't do me that much\ngood because uh that's just not how the\nthe the brain\nany more than knowing that I shouldn't\neat so many Oreos keeps you from eating\nthem if they're on the table in front of\nme. And I think you bring something up\nthat's really important, which is, you\nknow, these things need to be regulated.\nIt's ridiculous that they're out there\nbeing used by kids. Like, and it's\nridiculous to say, Ezra, it's your\nwillpower that should be the deciding\nfactor. It's ridiculous for adults. It's\nridiculous for kids. These are\nincredibly seductive technologies. So\nwhat I you know I this is this is a\nreally tough one for me around because\nyou do want kids to be fluent in the new\ntechnology of the time and you do want\nthem to have an ethics and awareness\nabout it. You don't want them to be\nseduced by it. The large AI labs are\nperfectly capable, perfectly capable, if\nthey wanted to, of creating a Gen AI\nproduct that is designed for kids that\nwill not be as seductive.\nIt's interesting. I was just thinking\nabout that and I wonder I I think they\nare, but I also wouldn't\noverstate how well they even understand\nwhat it is they are doing. They don't\nfully understand the systems they're\nmaking. Now the kids are more I mean\nrelentlessly the kids are more capable\nand\ningenious than you know the eight or 40\nor 100 developers on any given when\nyou're building something that has a\nsmall number of hundreds of people\nbuilding it and then it's used by 40,000\nkids. I think our um experience is that\nthey are clever in ways typically that\nthat you are not. Um I I do think that\nover time we can create things that are\nthat that are curbed. It's just that I'm\nnot sure we even know exactly what we\nare targeting. What we are creating.\nWell, I would say they're the they have\nto change how they're developing the\nproducts. You can't create um an AI\nthat'll be great for kids and teachers\nand teaching and learning without having\nteachers and kids and education experts\nand child development experts in the\ndevelopment process with you. and so few\nare. So I think about what um the Dutch\ngovernment is doing. They're doing a\npartnership with sort of the teacher\nunions and the academics and the tech\ncompanies and they're having a little\nlab to figure out how to you know what\nwould AI look like in in schools. But\nany of that sort of bottomup\nexperimentation is a is a way to go\nbefore you roll it out because most AI\ndevelopers, although they might be good\npeople, they're not child development\nspecialists. But if they change the way\nthey develop their products, they could.\nSo then I want to go back to to where we\nbegan, which is, you know, you've got\nyoung kids now. They're going to be\ngoing into school in the age of Genai.\nHow should you think about their\nschooling? So, we can't really predict\nthe shape of society in 15 or 20 years.\nI don't think that's a question we could\nanswer on the show. If we could, we\nshould probably be investing, not\npodcasting. But what we have in\neducation now is constant\nmarkers that are supposed to tell us as\nparents how well our kids education is\ngoing. And that's basically grades and\nmaybe to some degree counselor reports.\nAnd the idea is if they get good grades\nand they seem happy and well adjusted,\nthen at the end of that process, they'll\ngo to a good college or, you know, go to\na trade school and get a good job. And\nand it's going to be a pretty straight\nline. All A's equal good job. The future\nis foggier. What they will need to know\nis maybe a little foggier.\nWhat then should a parent be trying to\nwatch in the meantime? How do you think\nabout whether or not your kid's\neducation is going well if you're a\nlittle\nsuspicious that the grades designed\nfor and maybe even not that well\ndesigned for the society we have had are\nnot going to correlate all that well to\nthe society we will have.\nAnd I think as a parent, you yourself,\nbut also other parents out there are\nright to be suspicious because I think\nthat linear line is going to be much\nmore complicated as the years go on with\nAI in our world. So what I would think\nabout is a couple of things. One,\ngetting back to the research I've done\nwith my co-author and colleague Jenny\nAnderson, grades don't show you how\nmuch kids are engaged. Schools are not\ndesigned to give kids agency. Schools\nare designed to help kids comply. And\nit's actually not really the fault of\nthe teacher. teachers are squished from\nabove with all sorts of standards and\nsquished from below with parents, you\nknow, putting a lot of pressure on, you\nknow, teachers about their kids'\nperformance and outcome. And what you\nreally want is some feedback loops that\nare beyond just grades and behavior like\nto know is my kid developing agency over\ntheir learning. And what I mean by that\nis are they able to reflect and think\nabout things they're learning in a way\nthat they can identify what's\ninteresting and they can p have the\nskills to pursue new information. That\nright there is I think going to be the\ncore skill. It is the core skill for\nlearning new things in an uncertain\nworld which is I think one of the number\none things we think about. In addition\nto that, I would say make sure kids are\nlearning to interact with other human\nbeings. Any school that has them working\nwith peers, but even connecting with\ncommunity members. our um social\nnetworks are getting smaller. There's\ngoing to be a premium on humanto human\ninteraction as more and more um skills\nget automated and done by by I by AI\nwhich are the more knowledge sort of\ncognitive tasks the sort of\ninterpersonal caregiving teaching you\nknow skills are going to continue to be\nimportant for some for some time. I'm\nnot sure for how long but for some time.\nAnd then the last thing which may seem\nsilly to you but I increasingly keep\nthinking about is think about uh\nspeaking listening and speaking as the\nmissing piece of literacy alongside\nreading and writing. We are going to\nneed to show our merit and our sort of\ncredentials more and more through what\nthe British call oracy skills. You know,\nI I think we've lost the art of\nlistening and speaking. I think that's a\ngood place to end. Thank you for\nspeaking and listening with me. Always\nour final question. What are three books\nyou'd recommend to the audience? So the\nfirst one is democracy and education by\nJohn\nDwey which is over 100 years old and we\nare now seeing through lots of great\nneuroscience that his observations\naround the teaching and learning\nexperience and what makes for a good\nteaching and learning experience were\nright. He has some great discussions\naround the importance of reflection. not\njust ingesting knowledge but reflecting\non it, making meaning, figuring out how\nto do things with it. And I I love it\nbecause, you know, we didn't talk about\nthis Ezra much, but the role of schools\nin our society are more than just your\nand my kids education and getting a job,\neven though that's what we care about\nmost as a parent. They are about\ncreating a democratic society or not.\nSo, that that's an oldie but goodie. I\nlove it. John Dwey. Um the second book\nis by Gia Bernstein. It's called\nUnwired: Gaining Control Over Addictive\nTechnologies. She's a law professor at\nSatan Hall University. and she I I\nreally enjoy this book because it gives\na really good sort of overview\nparticularly around kids and young\npeople of the incentives that commercial\ntech has and how we need to sort of what\nare some strategies for resisting that\nand getting to a a better place. And the\nlast one it's called blueprint for\nrevolution. How to use rice pudding,\nLego men, and other nonviolent\ntechniques to galvanize communities,\noverthrow dictators, or simply change\nthe world by Sergio Papovich, who is uh\nthe was the student sort of leader,\nSerbian student leader that started a\nmovement to overthrow Sloan Malloich and\nnow is doing quite a bit of work on um\nnonviolent protest against\nauthoritarianism.\nAnd to me, this book is sort of like the\nupdated version of non-violent activism.\nHe really\ngets media. He really gets social media.\nAnd I just think it's incredibly\nrelevant today. Rebecca Winthrop, thank\nyou very much. Thank you.\n[Music]", "language": "en-US", "title": "Educating Kids in the Age of A.I. | The Ezra Klein Show"}
