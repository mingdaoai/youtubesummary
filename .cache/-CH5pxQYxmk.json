{"transcript": "back to the wealth academy educational\nseries I'm Adam Koo and have you ever\nwonder what's the best strategy to use\nwhen you enter the stock market should\nyou enter for a short term for the long\nterm should you buy a whole and\ndollar-cost average or should you trend\nfollow by only on the uptrend and exit\non the downtrend should use more\nfundamental analysis or technical\nanalysis and when is the best time to\nenter exit that stop well if all the\npens on a kind of stocks you're buying\nbecause all stars are different they've\ngot different characteristics and they\nbehave differently and it all depends on\nthe objective of buying that stock so\nlet's understand the different kind of\nstock categories and which ones you\nshould be buying before that please\npause the video and meet the risk\ndisclaimer so you understand the risk of\ninvesting\nonce you're ready let's continue\nif you look at the entire universe of\nstocks that can be divided into two\ncategories two main categories kind of\nlike human beings are divided into males\nand females so the first category would\nbe defensive stocks can imagine sounds\nlike a male defensive right so defensive\nstocks are stocks of companies that sell\na product or service that is a necessity\nso in other words in the worst recession\nyou still have to use that product for\nexample toothpaste or detergent or soap\nor toilet paper you won't say because of\nthe recession I'm not going to brush my\nteeth anymore right so as a result these\ncompanies have very consistent sales and\nprofits regardless of the economic cycle\nbecause people will still buy their\nprograms these are often known as boring\nbusinesses I mean think of it is\ntoothpaste really exciting no it's\nboring right but biotechnology is\nexciting high tech is exciting that is\nboring now boring may not always be bad\nin fact Warren Buffett once said that he\nloves boring businesses because they are\nso predictable they never change it's\nalways the same so you've got a little\nnew competition coming in because it's\nboring people want to go into the next\nexciting thing so these are boring that\nare predictable but have stagnant or\nmoderate growth so don't expect 20\npercent growth rate expect more like 5\nto 6 percent growth rate but these are\ngreat for investors who do not mind\nmoderate returns with low volatility\nthe offensive stocks tend to outperform\nduring a recession so if you look back\nat the previous recessions when the\ngeneral stock market's collapsing\ndefensive stocks were going up or at\nleast they went sideways they never went\ndown why because people still use their\nproducts so the best time to buy\ndefensive stops is when you expect a\nrecession to hit and to last for one at\nthe same time defensive stocks tend to\nunderperform during an economic boom\nwhen the recession is over and economy\nrecovers you know stocks will start\ngoing up they start recovering and\nthe offensive stops are the last ones to\nrecover up or the last ones to move up\nthey move really slowly\nso if you look below these are what we\ncall defensive products or defensive\ncompanies\nwhat would a stock chart look like well\nfirst you look at the entire US market\nthese are the defensive sectors health\ncare\nconsumer staples and utilities so you\ncould buy the individual companies like\nJohnson & Johnson and bought\nLaboratories PepsiCo coca-cola complete\nclap or you could buy the entire sector\netf call the XLV or the xlp or the xlu\nand by buying their etf you get exposure\nto all the complicity in that sector\ntypically if you look at a defensive\nstop what do you think that chart looks\nlike the stock chart looks like\nyeah you guessed it it looks something\nlike this if you look at a five or ten\nyear horizon notice the stop price goes\nup very consistently on a very clear\nuptrend with very shallow dips because\nit's defensive\nnow the opposite of defensive stops\nwould be psychical stocks I'll call them\ngoodsoon stocks alright so cycle starts\nas stocks of companies that sell\nproducts or services that are a luxury\nor they are highly dependent on the\neconomic situation so for example\nautomobiles during good times you may go\nup to buy a car or refrigerator or\n$10,000 massage chair right you you\nborrow from the banks for example you\nbuild a house but in times of recessions\nwith times I bet you cut back on these\nluxuries you don't you know buy a new\ncar and you don't change your\nrefrigerator you don't borrow as much on\nthe bank so it's a result these\ncompanies generate very high sales and\nprofits during economic expansions but\nthey generate low profits or they make\nhuge losses during recessions and\ncontractions so their stock price as we\nvery much correlated to the health of\nthe economy\nthese are great for investors who are\nwilling to experience high volatility\nhuge swings the value of their stock but\nfor higher gears now psychical stops\nperform badly during a recession for\nobvious reasons when a recession hits\nthese are the stocks that drop like\nflies they drop the fastest and the\nfirst but a same time an economy\nrecovers and bottoms these thoughts fly\nthey're the first to go up they go up\nthe fastest so obviously you only want\nto buy second or stocks during an\neconomic recovery and expansion and you\nwant to buy defensive stops when it come\nis going to recession so that's how\nprofessionals shift your portfolio's run\nbetween defensive as fickle stocks so\nthese are the psychical well before I\nshow you the sector's take a look at the\nchart\ntypically one that's a Chan to black if\nyou look at a cycle stop over five to\nten years the price looks exactly at the\nroller-coaster ride goes all the way up\nand collapses all the way up goes down\nall the way up and all the way down\nso in general you do not want to buy and\nhold psychical stocks unless you want to\ngo on a rollercoaster ride a half a\nheart attack okay if you want to buy a\nhome for the long term and close your\neyes and use what we call dollar cost\naveraging you want to do that only for\ndefensive stocks for psychical stocks\neven time your entry using technical\nanalysis you only want to buy when the\nprice starts an uptrend and you want to\nbuy near the bottom and that's where\ntechnical analysis can help you to\ndetermine\nsupport head bottoms and resistance at\ntops and where the main trend channel\nline or the range of the stock and a\nsame time when the stock is a high level\nand a short seller start at a resistance\nand progress it collapses next to that\nthe dollar support or the bottom edge of\nthe stock typically these are cyclical\nstocks or psychical sectors we will\nconsumer discretionary these are luxury\ngoods you have technology\ncompanies\nindustrials\nfinance\nenergy and materials so once again you\ncan buy the individual stocks of these\nsectors or you can buy the entire sector\nETF and among these sectors I would say\nthat industrials\nmaterials are the more psychical and\ntechnology is the least likely go\nbecause I mean in the worst recession\nyou students technology right so they\nare psychical but they're in a secular\nbull market and that's why Apple for\nexample Conti to do well during the\nfinancial crisis because people still\nuse the products and technology\nthe difference between defensive and\npsychical stocks let's get more specific\nso just as the universe of human beings\ncan be further subdivided into different\nraces and cultures so can stocks in fact\nstocks can be divided into about six\nspecific categories and which cat ririn\nvessel depends on your objectives and\ndepends on your needs because each\ncategory has got different\ncharacteristics and each category the\nstocks behave very differently so let's\ntake a look at the first category\ncategory number one would be income or\ndividend stocks these are specifically\ncompanies that pay a percentage of their\nprofits out as dividends and not all\ncompanies do this in fact companies that\ntend to do this are large mature\ncompanies in a slow growth industry why\nbecause the profits they make they don't\nhave much things to invest in anymore\nthey're not growing anymore so they've a\nlot excess cash today just return to\nshareholders\nso when you buy these companies your\nobjective is not really in or capital\ngains because these companies don't grow\nany more or they grew very slowly your\nobjective is it only in collecting\ndividends or passive income from the\ncompany every quarter of every year so\nwhen you invested income stocks you're\nlooking for certain characteristics you\nwant the companies to have a dividend\nyou of at least four to five percent you\nwant the companies to be consistently\nincreasing their dividend per share for\nthe last five years\nyou want the company to be consistently\nincreasing your net income and cash flow\noperations for the last five years you\nwant a share price to be stable and not\ntoo volatile you want it to be the range\nor slowly trending up the best kind of\ndividend stocks would be defensive\ncompanies and predictable companies\nwhere their product highlight changes so\nyou can be showing ten years they're\nstill gonna be around so for dividend\nstocks avoid psychical stocks like\nairlines\ncommodities shipping property and so on\nand so forth you want consumer stable\ncompanies\nyou want more defensive companies so\nexamples of defensive and dividend\npaying stocks in Singapore would be star\nSingTel you have no Singapore Press\nHoldings in the US you got McDonald's go\ncook a : got 3m you got Clorox you have\nHoneywell you have Hershey's chocolates\nall right and\nfour different companies you intend to\nbuy and hold for the long term to\ncollect the dividends so you want the\ncompany to have conservative debt one\nway is to look at the interest cuddle\nratio which is net interest expense\ndivided by cash flow from operations you\nwant it to be less than 30% which means\ntheir debt exposure is conservative so\nagain you can dollar-cost average and\nbuy all these companies if you want to\nthe second category of stocks I would\nsay our Warren Buffett's frame rate\nthese are large cap predictable\ncompanies again a company is predictable\nwhen the probe never changes for example\na hundred years ago Coca Cola's program\nand coca-cola today's the same program\nit never changes all right and these are\nnot the products and services you use\nregularly these are large companies that\nare wide economic modes\nsustainable competitive advantage and\nvery predictable earnings and cash flow\nfrom operations\nagain their proper service never goes\nobsolete and it tends to be defensive in\nnature\nlarge cap predictable offer you slow but\nsteady capital appreciation with growth\nrates between five to ten percent\nagain these are companies you can buy a\nhome for the long term and even\ndollar-cost average and they are very\nsimilar to the dividend paying ones but\nthey may or may not pay dividends so\nClorox again Colgate coca-cola\nMcDonald's tree and these are large cap\npredictable\nso typically if you look at their chart\nin on a long-term basis they make a very\nclear uptrend like the case of Cody with\nvery minor dips along the way\nthe third category of stocks would be\nlarge cap\nhigh-growth companies so these are\nnormally large companies that have\nextremely high growth potential they\ngrow at five to ten percent like\npredictable companies but I grab twenty\ntwenty five fifty percent a year as a\nresult your high growth their price is\nnormally selling at a premium their\nprice is usually near or above that\nintrinsic value and\nyour share price is usually on a very\nsteep uptrend it's going up really\nexponentially\nso these are stocks you buy not for\ndividends usually these companies do not\npay dividends why because they keep\nreinvesting a capital into technology\nand groove and new markets so the share\nprice has to go up really fast however\nwas the dancer of large-cap growth\nstocks that's right they can't grow\nforever the high growth is not\nsustainable and the moment that growth\nslows down these stocks tend to collapse\nby fifty to sixty percent and some of\nthem never recover but Sunday may\neventually become low-proof stocks so\nthese are companies that are very\nrisky to bar and hole you never want to\nbuy and hold a growth company\nbecause eventually all the huge profits\nwould disappear for these companies you\nonly want to buy on up trends and you\nhave to exit the moment that downtrend\nhappens and in tanker analysis I'll\nteach you exactly how to read the\nchanging trend so examples of growth\nstarts with Facebook Amazon\nLinkedIn Netflix Priceline alphabet well\nthat used to be called Google Apple so\nif you look at LinkedIn for example\nrecently the stock price collapse by 50\npercent why because the growth slowed up\nTwitter was a grocer it collapsed so\nthese are stocks where you have to hit\nand run you can't hold on to them for\ntoo long next fourth category deep\ncyclicals\ndeep cyclicals are companies which are\nhighly capital intensive\nright we have huge equipment for example\nshipping companies\nmanufacturers a\nring or offshore rig oil rigs right if\nthe inability to respond to demand\nchanges quickly for example shipping\ncompany they have many ships they've got\nmany workers in a recession they can't\nsell their ship they can't find their\nworkers get start with this huge capital\nso as a result they lose a lot of money\nduring recessions when they are under\ncapacity but they make huge profits\nwhen the economy is doing well so\nexamples of deep cyclicals real estate\nfinance oil and gas companies offshore\nand marine and commodity companies\nnow deep psychic girls the price of the\nstock looks like a rollercoaster right\nagain it goes all the way up slams all\nthe way down all the way up all the way\ndown all the way up all the way down if\nyou look at it on a 10-year horizon the\nprice may end up to be at the same place\nwith after all those swings\nso these are companies again that you do\nnot want to buy in home\nyou only want to buy when the stock\nprice is near the bottom of the cycle\nnow how would you know that's where\ntechnical analysis and fundamental as it\ncomes in during the training programs\nand issue how to know and start his\nbottom and when it starts a new Uptrend\nthat's when you buy at the same time you\nmust sell these stocks the moment that a\npart of their cycle and you're just\nabout going to come down into a new\ndowntrend\ncategory number four or five if you turn\naround companies\nthese are good companies who stopped\nprices have been beaten down temporarily\nby bad news\nfor example they are here by financial\nscandals the CEO resign there's a\nproduct a fall or something like that\nand as a result of this temporary bad\nnews the stock price is you you way\nbelow the intrinsic value and again\nWarren Buffett likes to buy companies\nlike these where he believes the company\nthe company's competitive advantage and\nbusiness model is still intact it's just\nsuffering a temporary setback and the\nbest time to enter is when that price\nhas resumed this uptrend because you\nnever want to catch the bottom you never\nknow where the bottom is you can keep\ngoing low and lower as long as the bad\nnews is in place so example of\nturnaround companies would be the\nfinancial companies I banked after the\nfinancial crisis like Citigroup Bank of\nAmerica and it was selling way below\ntheir intrinsic value and book value\nthat was the time after started buying\nthem and you could buy them as well\ncurrently the oil and gas sector is\nreally undervalued because of all prices\ncollapsing and the good companies will\neventually recover they will turn around\nYahoo was a turnaround story but now\nit's going back down again so you have\nto learn how to exit after the\nturnaround is over anyway plunge into\nanother series of bad news\napples a turnaround compliment Steve\nJobs diet we managed to turn around Yum\nBrands is a turnaround when it faced\ndifficulties in China because of using\nexpired meat products so turnaround\ncompany the price only goes up and gets\nhit by bad news so you want to buy only\nwhen it starts to resume its uptrend and\nturns around you never want to catch the\nbottom and buy on a downtrend\nthe last category will be fast growers\nthese are small to medium sized\ncompanies that grow at least 25% a year\nnow remember every large company like a\nGoogle like an apple like like Twitter\nthere were one small companies so some\npeople they like to buy small companies\nbefore they grew huge that's when you\ncan see the value of your capital\nincrease by 5 to 10 to 15 to 20 times\nso possibility of very high returns if\nthese small companies they need to\nmedium or large companies it's kind of\nlike buying the baby before the baby\ngrows into an adult however buying small\ncompanies we call them small caps are\nmore risky not all them will survive\nright the inventor of narrow economic\nmodes they have got smaller comparative\nadvantages when it begin and they have\nprudential cash flow problems so you buy\nthese small companies you have to be\nmore stringent on their debt by them\nonly if they were caught conservative\ndebt and healthy cash flow so example of\nsmall companies that started growing big\nwould be amber\nNOAA holdings and global these are small\ncap companies\nso this concludes this educational video\non different stocks different strategies\ni'm adam crew", "language": "en", "title": "Stock Market Investing Strategies.
