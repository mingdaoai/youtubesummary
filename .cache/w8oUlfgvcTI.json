{"transcript": "I built two companies doing over $30\nmillion in sales by copying already\nsuccessful businesses.\nMeet Will. After the real estate crash\nin 2008, he lost everything and had to\nstart from scratch.\nWe didn't see it coming and we just\ntotally got crushed.\nThen he came across the opportunity to\nbuild a SAS, but he didn't do it in the\nconventional way. Instead of reinventing\nthe wheel and building something that\ndidn't exist yet, he developed a\nframework that led him to make millions\nof dollars. This is kind of the cold\nemail framework that we use for Uplead\nand I think anyone can kind of use this\nand apply this to their business today.\nIn this video, Will shares his\nmillion-dollar research framework, how\nto successfully copy lucrative\nbusinesses, and the one marketing\nstrategy that's made him millions of\ndollars.\nThe playbooks are already out there.\nMost people just don't study them.\nWhether you're a seasoned builder or\njust getting started, this episode might\nblow your mind. All right, let's get\ninto it. I'm Pat Walls and this is\nStarter Story.\nAll right, welcome Will to the channel.\nTell me about who you are, what you\nbuilt, and what's your story.\nMy name is Will Cannon. I built UpLED to\nover $30 million in sales, and I built\nSignature Lead to over 1.6 million users\nwithout raising a dime of funding. I did\nit all without reinventing the wheel. I\ntook business models that already had\nproduct market fit and I added my own\nlittle twist to them.\nOkay, cool. We're going to get all into\nthis framework of how you built these\nand took these proven markets. But\nfirst, I want to understand a little bit\nmore about your background. How do you\nget here to this place where you have\nthese awesome software businesses?\nSo, at 19, me and my girlfriend, who's\nnow my wife, started our first mortgage\ncompany. This was during the subprime\nmortgage boom. So, there was mortgages\nbeing handed out left and right. And we\nwere kind of new to the industry. We're\nlike, what's going on? We started making\nso much money we couldn't even believe\nit. And we thought we were on top of the\nworld. This was 2005, 2006, 2007.\nEverything was going great. And then the\nmortgage crisis hit. We didn't see it\ncoming and we just totally got crushed.\nSo, then it was time to rebuild. We were\nlike, \"Hey, what are we going to do\nnext?\" When we had our mortgage company,\nwe were sending a lot of cold emails to\nloan officers and real estate agents to\nrecruit them. And we had a couple people\nin our office that would ask us like,\n\"Hey, do you have a list of loan\nofficers or list of real estate agents?\"\nSo, we were kind of selling lists on the\nside and we thought, \"Hey, this could be\na business.\" So, we started diving into\nthat further. That's what we did for\nabout 10 years from 2007ish to 2017. We\nkept running into the same problem, data\nquality. And that was the kind of the\naha moment. We're like, \"Hey, there has\nto be a way or a software that can do\nthis for us.\" So that was the thought\nbehind Uplead and that was our\ntransition from 10 years of building an\nagency into SAS.\nAll right. Well, before we get into\nthese businesses that you built, how\nyou've grown them and the framework for\nfinding these ideas for these proven\nmarkets, can you break down how you\nactually found the ideas for your two\nbig software companies that you run now?\nFor Uple agency, so the data quality\nfrom the vendors on the market at the\ntime was around 50 to 60% accurate. We'd\nscrape the internet for data and that\ndata was also maybe 40 50% accurate.\nevery time we build a list, we'd have to\nverify the emails. We'd have to send the\nphone number list to a call center we\nhad in the Philippines to verify the\nphone numbers. And that was the kind of\nthe aha moment. We're like, hey, why\nisn't there a tool that can just do this\nfor us? Why isn't there a tool where I\ncan go in, I can punch in my ICP, I can\nsay, here's who I want to target. I\nclick download or export and it'll\ndownload and verify the emails and\nverify the phone numbers in real time.\nWe didn't find any software. We decided\nto build it ourselves for Signature\nLeague, which now has over 1.6 million\nusers. This is how we found the idea.\nThis was 2020 and we saw everything was\nmoving away from face to face. So we\nknew documents weren't being signed face\nto face anymore. They were being signed\nover the internet. So we looked this\nmodel up and we saw Docu Sign was the\nbiggest player in the game. They were\npublic. They had a ton of revenue. But\ntheir product was complicated. It wasn't\neasy to use. So we thought there has to\nbe a better way. Why don't we build a\nsimple, easy to use version of DocYsine\nthat was so easy to use your grandmother\ncould use it. That's how we knew this\nbusiness could be successful. There was\nalready proven product market fit. There\nwas a need in the market for customers\nthat wanted a simple version of a tool\nthat was already on the market and we\nused our SEO and cold email and other\nskill sets to acquire customers\nprofitably.\nOkay. So, you did this for two very\nsuccessful businesses. You have this\nframework for finding ideas that are\nalready proven and then just going and\nbuilding them doing them somewhat\ndifferently. Can you walk me through\nthis framework so that someone watching\ncould potentially do the same? Step one\nis I would look for markets that already\nhave product market fit. I mean, I'm not\nSteve Jobs. I had 1.5 GPA growing up.\nSo, I thought it was a lot easier to go\ninto a market that already has product\nmarket fit. Now that you found a market\nthat you want to compete in, the next\nstep is finding your unique angle,\nputting a unique twist on it. It can't\njust be pricing. It can't just be, hey,\nwe're like XYZ, but a little bit more\naffordable. There has to be some unique\ntwist to it. So, go look at the one and\ntwo star reviews and see what people are\ncomplaining about. See what they dislike\nabout the best players in the market.\nThat's our twist. Our twist is what\npeople dislike about the biggest\ncompanies in the space because those are\nthe easiest customers to go after and\nacquire. And that's step three,\nacquiring customers profitably. Now,\nthis is the hardest part, but if you can\nget this right, you can build any\nbusiness. This is the hardest part\nbecause you have to have a skill set\nhere. Whether it's cold email, whether\nit's cold calling, whether it's SEO,\nwhether it's ads. So, my skill sets are\naround cold email, cold calling, SEO,\nand a few others. I acquired all of\nthese by reading books, by watching\nYouTube videos. And step four is\nexecution. Most people talk about\nbuilding a business, but actually\nbuilding it is a lot harder. You're\ngoing to fail. You're going to have to\nget back up. You're going to have to\nkeep going. And this playbook, it might\nnot work the first time. I failed at\nprobably over 20 different businesses\nbefore having two successful businesses.\nI think that framework is awesome. I\nlove that playbook. Clearly, it's worked\nfor you for two very successful\nbusinesses. But for anyone who's\nwatching right now, I think they might\nbe wondering, how can I do this right\nnow? What are the opportunities that can\nwork in 2025? I'm sure you've come\nacross a bunch of painful problems that\nyou love to solve, but you don't have\ntime for. What would you be building\nright now that the audience can learn\nfrom?\nOne idea is a super simple CRM. Almost\nevery business needs a CRM. It's a big\nmarket. It's fragmented. There's\nmultiple companies doing billions of\ndollars in revenue. This is an area I\nwould probably look at if I was building\nsomething new today. Number two, I would\nsay a payroll software for small\nbusinesses. You have a bunch of\ncompanies in the space. Again, really\nfragmented, multiple winners in the\nspace. If you look at Fresh Books and\ntheir SEO strategy around templates and\ntools, I'd probably copy that playbook\nright there, right? They've built the\nplaybook for you. There's an SEO\nadvantage I would have in that market.\nNumber three, I would say a website\nanalytics tool. Every business needs to\nanalyze their metrics, their funnel, how\nmuch traffic they're getting to their\nwebsite, attribution, ROI. Your market\nis almost infinite. And if you can tie\nin some new things right now around AI,\naround maybe mentions on LLMs within the\nanalytics tool, I think that'd be a cool\ntool to start today.\nAll right, before we keep going here, I\ndo got to call out something I've been\nseeing with a lot of founders right now.\nYou're moving fast. Maybe you're close\nto product market fit or you're prepping\nfor your next round, but then enterprise\nprospects start asking about your\nsecurity compliance and suddenly\neverything slows down. The reality is\nthat in 2025, especially with AI,\nsecurity expectations hit earlier and\nharder than ever. You can either get\nahead of it or let it become the thing\nthat kills your momentum. Vanta, today's\nsponsor, basically solves that entire\nheadache. Instead of spending months\nfiguring out SOCK 2 compliance, Vanta's\nautomated workflows get you audit ready\nfast. And here's what I really like\nabout the platform. It's not just a\none-time setup. It keeps monitoring and\nupdating as you scale. Fast growing\nstartups like Langchain, Writer, and\nCursor trusted Vanta to build their\nsecurity foundation early, which means\nthey can focus on growth instead of\ngetting stuck in compliance hell. Right\nnow, Vanta is offering $1,000 off for\nStarter Story viewers. So, check out\nvanta.com/starter\nor click the first link in the\ndescription. Over 12,000 companies are\nalready using Vanta to scale smarter.\nHuge thank you to Vanta for partnering\nwith us at Startertory. Let's dive back\ninto the interview. I want to hear a\nlittle bit more about your businesses\nthat you built. We haven't really talked\nabout them yet, but can you share the\ntwo businesses that you built in\nsoftware that are crushing it right now?\nWhat do they do? How do they work? And\nhow are they doing? Uple is a B2B data\nprovider with real-time verified emails,\nmobile numbers, and buyer intent\nsignals. Uple has over $4,000 customers\ncurrently. It's done over $30 million in\nsales, and it gets over 100,000 visits\nto its website every month. And the\nother business I have is Signaturely.\nIt's an e signature company. It's an\neasy and simple to use alternative to\ndocuine. So, Signaturely has over 1.6\nmillion users. It's done over 1.5\nmillion in sales and it gets over\n800,000 visits per month.\nOkay, cool. And those are amazing\nbusinesses beyond the framework for\nfinding these ideas, which we talked a\nbunch about. I'd also be curious to hear\nabout how you actually grew and scaled\nthese businesses. Can you tell me a\nlittle bit more about that?\nUple got its first 1 million in annual\nrecurring revenue strictly from cold\nemail. So, this is kind of the cold\nemail framework that we use for Uplead\nand I think anyone can kind of use this\nand apply this to their business today.\nSo, here's the cold email that got us\nour first million dollars in ARR. I'll\nbreak it down. The subject line is, \"Hi,\nfirst name.\" So, hi James. The first\nline is, \"I was checking out your\nLinkedIn profile and thought this could\nbe of value to you. We built a tool\ncalled Uple, which is like Zoom Info but\nwith real-time email verification, and\nwe're really affordable. Are you open to\ntrying it out at no cost?\" So, the\nsubject line is, \"Hi, James. It looks\nlike it came from a real person.\" The\nintro is neutral and direct. I saw your\nprofile. There's no hype there. The\nvalue prop is clear and familiar. We\nframed it against the biggest company in\nthe market, Zoom Info, but better. We\ntold what our twist is. And then the\nask, are you open to trying it out at no\ncost? We try to make the ask so easy\nit's hard to say no. You don't need long\nemails. You need short ones that feel\nhuman. And I think any business can take\nthis. They can tweak those lines and\nthey can send out the same cold email\nthat we did. So from Signature, we got\nfrom 0 to 1.6 million users mainly from\nSEO. We use the strategy around tools\nand templates and ranking for them high\nin search in order to get our first\ncustomers. We built a free online\nsignature tool where you can type or\nhanddraw your signature and you can\ndownload it and then we push them to go\nuse that to sign documents. So that was\na one of the tools we use as part of our\nfunnel. And then we also wrote\ntemplates. So we wrote marketing\nagreements and construction agreements\nand landlord agreements and we ranked a\nbunch of templates. Templates and\ncontracts and that was how we got our\nfirst thousand plus customers.\nOkay. Well, thanks for sharing that. I\nmean, SEO, I love SEO. Big reason\nStarter Story grew as well. The last\nquestion that I have for you that we ask\neveryone who comes on Starter Story, you\nbuilt these amazing businesses. What\nwould you say to a younger Will, if you\ncould stand on his shoulder and give him\nadvice from when you were just starting\nout, you had the failed mortgage\ncompany. What would be your advice to\nsomeone just starting out like you?\nHave these big, hairy, audacious goals,\nthese crazy goals, these moonshots,\nright? I remember when I was first\nstarting out, I thought if I could just\nmake $5,000 a month, that would be\nenough. and then you hit that and then\nyou go to the next level. So have big\ngoals. Another one is things are going\nto come up every day that get in your\nway. Don't sweat the small stuff. Think\nabout the big picture. Another piece of\nadvice is you have to just keep going.\nYou're going to fail. You're going to\nhave to get back up, right? I failed at\nprobably 15, 20 different businesses\nbefore I built two that were super\nsuccessful. Well, thanks for coming on\nthe channel. I appreciate you sharing\nyour story and these amazing businesses\nthat you built. Hope to have you on\nagain sometime and see your businesses\ngrow even more. So, thanks for coming\non.\nThanks for having me, Pat. Thanks again\nto Will for coming on to the channel and\nsharing his story. I love his approach\nto building businesses where it's not\nabout creating a whole new category, but\ninstead just adding a small twist on\nwhat's already out there.
