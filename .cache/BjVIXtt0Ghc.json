{"transcript": "In this video, I'll be breaking down how\na small app studio from Romania managed\nto scale an app to $300,000 US in\nmonthly Rare King revenue. You're going\nto learn about four things. First is how\nto establish high converting onboarding\nflows so that you can turn a free user\ninto a paid user. Second, the viral Tik\nTok and Instagram organic content\nstructure that they're producing so that\nyou can produce for your own app. The\nthird is their hidden marketing strategy\naka paid ads that really enable them to\nscale faster than ever. and fourth, the\nexact implementation process of how you\ncan quite literally take their entire\nmarketing system and use it and apply to\nyour own app. All right, so let's begin\nthis video. For those who don't know me,\nmy name is Benji, a 20-year-old college\nstudent who built an app studio with\nover 15 apps and 80,000 users, scaled to\n$150,000 in profit, also worked with\npeople who scaled their apps to 30 and\n$40,000 in monthly recurring revenue.\nSo, I've been in the app space for quite\na bit of time. To be fully honest with\nyou, there are two reasons why I'm\nmaking this video. First is to explore\npotential clients for my agency. I can\nbuild your app in under 20 days. I have\na great developer team from big tech\ncompanies. And if you're a first-time\nfounder or you don't know how to code\nyour app, you can hit me up through the\nlink in the description down below.\nBolivarbuilder.com or benji.app. Fill\nout a form and I'll reach out to you.\nSecond is I'm trying to build an app\nfounder a community where I can meet\nother like-minded individuals who are\nbuilding apps. So if you're watching\nthis video, chances are you're one of\nthem. So feel free to join as well. Link\nin description. Now let's finally get\nstarted. Let's first talk about\nonboarding flow. So, as you guys know,\nonboarding flow really makes or breaks\nan app, especially if it is a payto-use\napp. So, if you have a hard pay wall,\nall the user is going to see before\nusing your app is the value proposition\nthat you showcase via your onboarding\nflow. So, you have to make sure it is\noptimized. So, as you can see in Bible\nChad's onboarding flow, they have their\nintroduction and their social proof.\nThey showcases uh their user\ntestimonials. They showcase their value\nad where it says, \"Deepend your\nrelationship with God.\" Just quite\nliterally shows you what you get out of\nthis app, right? And after that, you see\nquiz questions. So, they're going to ask\nquestions about your journey with\nChristianity and how they can probably\njust showcase how they can customize\ntheir entire app journey to your\npreferences so that you feel heard and\nthis app experience is super customized\nto the point where you have a higher\nbuying intent. The third type of screen\nthey have in their onboarding flow is\napp explainer. So, after asking three or\nfour questions, they insert an app\nexplainer explaining how their app is\nable to provide value to you, right? So,\nfor example, this screen says how Bible\nchat can help you receive personalized\nguidance to overcome challenges. Or this\nsecond screen that says, \"Dive deeper\ninto verses with questions.\" Because\nhaving a longer onboarding usually\nsignifies that the sunk cost of users\nusing your app is higher, so they're\nmore likely to pay for something that\nthey have spent tremendous amount of\ntime on, right? The the sunk cost\nfallacy for a lot of people. But, you\nknow, just answering like 30 questions\nright away is super boring. So, they try\nto insert this to just to remind you of\nthe value that they can provide. Again,\nlet's go through. Let's keep going on.\nIt asks, \"What's your age group?\" Ask\nquestions. And then again, uh app\nexplainer, ask questions. App explainer,\nuh showcase of value, continues and\ncontinues, right? So, finally, they have\nthis analysis and quiz question where\nthey just try to show that they're in\nsome way quantitative and analytical so\nthat you think this is actually\nsomething legit. Let's move on to the\nsecond part, which is the payw wall.\nthey actually use a soft payw wall,\nwhich is a payroll that the user is\nactually able to skip and isn't forced\nto enter their billing information to\naccess the app, unlike with a hard pay\nwall where that's the case. I've only\nbuilt apps with hard pay walls, but it's\na very similar user psychology, right?\nSo, as you can see right here, they have\na 7-day preview where uh they showcase\nyour value um and users are able to opt\nin for a free trial on a weekly plan or\na no trial via the annual plan. when a\nbuyer thinks that they have choices that\nmakes them more comfortable in engaging\nwith purchasing behaviors. So having\nthis optionality where you can either\nchoose between a 7-day free trial or a\nyearly access actually has shown time\nand time again to increase conversion\nrates for users. Now, as you can also\nsee, there is a hidden paywall exit.\nActually, when users click on it,\nthey're hit with a one-time offer. This\nis called a CRO improvement. So that\nthey're hit with you with an 80% off\ndiscount where you think you're getting\na bargain, right? If somebody tried to\nbuy a paid plan, but then they\ncancelceled out of it, nothing happens.\nSo, this is like a chance to convert a\nwarm lead, like a warm user to actually\npaying for your product, right? Cuz from\nan app developer perspective, once the\nuser click on that X to exit that pay\nwall, usually it means you're going to\nlose that user and it's really bad for\nbusiness. So, uh, with a high profit\nmargin business like software, it\ndoesn't really make sense for them to\nnot offer an x% off discount just to\nincrease their conversion rate. As you\ncan also see on this payw wall, they\nhave a conversion hack where this\ndiscount toggle quite literally just\nagain feeds into that illusion of choice\nwhere I want to try the app for free.\nMaking the trial only available for\nweekly plan would also squeeze more\nlifetime customer value out of each user\nand make them more money. A lot of\npeople just they just forget that they\nsubscribed to an app, right? I think\nthere's a stat out there that says over\n70% of users quite literally don't\nrecall having subscribed to some of the\napps that they're so subscribed and pay\nfor. All right, perfect. So, we have\ndone quite literally 90% of the product\nwork, which is onboarding and payw wall.\nRight after that, it is just having a\ngood product just means higher ratings\non app store and lower turn rates so\nthat the lifetime customer value is\nhigher. Right? If you have a bad app,\nthey're most likely going to unsubscribe\nor turn away. you're not going to make\nmoney from reoccurring subscriptions.\nSo, as you can see, after the payment,\nthe user is brought directly into their\nfirst journal entry, which would then\nintroduce them into the app and rewards\nthem for going through the whole\nonboarding so that they understand how\nto use the app. Your user happiness is\nonly maximized when they actually know\nhow to use your app. So, this is sort of\nlike a de facto tutorial, but integrated\nin a really good way. Let's look at\nstreaks and notifications. This is a way\nto increase users engagement rate with\nthe app. So after submitting their first\njournal entry as a Christian, they're\ngiven their first win and start their\nstreaks. This is taken from Dualingo and\nSnapchat where pretty much you\nincentivize users with some gamification\naspects to your app so they feel\nrewarded. There's that psychological\ninherent uh reward system that just\ntriggers within a user's brain and that\nsubconsciously tells them to, you know,\ntry to aim for the second streak, the\nthird street and so on and so forth,\nwhich increases their usage of the app,\nmaking them more reliant on the app and\ndecreases their likelihood of\nunsubscribing from the app. Shies have\nshown that users who are engaged with\nactive streaks are 8 to 15% more likely\nto stay with the app itself. Also, on\nthe contrary side, if a user loses out\non a streak, right? Just imagine if you\nhave a 200 day streak and you lost that\nstreak, you're probably going to be less\nmotivated to actually use the app\nbecause you think about the cost. Oh, I\nhad 200 days of streaks. Right now, I'm\nstarting from zero. I'm really not\nmotivated enough. So, that actually\nmight increase the turn rate of your\nusers. So, try to go with an incremental\nstreak system with smaller rewards.\nDon't try to do zero or 100, right?\nDon't be too extreme within your streak\nsystem or else that drop off period is\njust going to turn user away. You can\nprobably just aim to highlight total\nprogress rather than just consecutive\ndays. So Bible chat is one of the very\nrare occasions where Fremia model is\nactually working. So let's assume you're\na user that is free and you went into\ntheir uh app and you try using it.\nYou're still going to be hit with pay\nwalls, soft pay walls. You're limited\nwithin the functionalities of the app\nand you're just again reenouraged to pay\nfor the app. So these are so small\ntriggers that they implement uh to free\nusers to increase conversion rates.\nGreat. Now we finished talking about the\nproduct. Let's talk about the\ndistribution side. So I'm going to break\nthis up into two parts. The organic\nmarketing side and the paid marketing\nside. Let's talk about organic first. So\nthere are two ways that they're posting\ncontent. One is Instagram, one is Tik\nTok. Both optimized for short form\ncontent. So, as you guys can see in this\nscreenshot, I show you that they have a\nlot of different Bible chat accounts on\nInstagram just posting different reels.\nBut you can see that all their CTA call\nto action button uh in their link in bio\nis just simply a URL that enables them\nto track conversion rates and track\nleads where the leads are coming from\nand which ultimately directs to their\napp store. Right? This is not a typical\napp store link. It's a bible chat\napp.link.mme\nand there's a bunch of like code name\nwhich they can just use to track which\nInstagram is getting them the highest\nconversion rate. This is good because\nsometimes a lot of these app founders\nthey outsource their marketing to other\npartners in which their deal structure\nusually relies on some sort of affiliate\nstructure. So you have to be able to\nidentify who is doing better so that you\ncould reward them with higher pay if\nthey're bringing you more value or lower\npay if you're not working at all. The\nformats that are going viral on\nInstagram are Christian memes. Memes are\nreally easy to get a lot of views, but\nyou have to understand the conversion\nrates are usually low. So the typical\nstructure that people structure a meme\nis a 3se secondond hook, which is a meme\nlike a POV. you are doing this or only\nChristians will understand this and you\nhook the users in and you somehow\nincorporate a call to action video where\nthe influencer is just seemingly using\nyour app just just like in a non-obvious\nway and people are intrigued because\nentire story line is still very good but\nalso they see this really interesting\nproduct that they might want to check\nout and in which in the video you can\nhave a CTA a soft CTA you can also see\naside from their main accounts they have\nother influencers which which are pretty\nmuch just girls with the same video\nformats of like a 3se secondond, oh, I'm\nsuper shocked of this app and whatever\nand then followed up by a product demo.\nThis performs extremely well. They\nprobably establish a CPM structure of $1\nto $3 per 1,000 views. So, they pay\nbased on results with these influencers.\nThey create an completely new slide\naccount for this app specifically, and\nthey just post three times a day on that\naccount. And it's just the same video\nreused over and over again. I remember\nclearly on my first app, Pillar, which\nis a self-improvement app. We went\nextremely viral, 50 million views in the\nfirst three weeks, just making memes. We\ndid not really have any converting\nusers, although we have 10,000 users as\nof right now. Those viral videos did not\nreally convert because the videos itself\nwas just a meme. So, it just went viral\nas a meme. People watching those memes\nare not going to convert to actual\npaying users because we're not\nspecifically promoting a product within\nthe video in a nice way. So, just\nremember, just follow this format. 3\nsecond hook plus a clear call to action\ndemo video of your product. Great. On\nTik Tok is quite literally the same\nthing. You can produce a video for\nInstagram and then post it on Tik Tok.\nIt's not going to interfere with each\nother. You can also maybe try YouTube\nshorts. Nobody has has really done that\nand has achieved some, you know, really\namazing results just purely based on\nYouTube shorts. But I guess I assume,\nyou know, if you're already producing\nall those videos, then you can probably\njust spend like 5 seconds posting it on\nYouTube shorts because I don't think\nit's going to harm your app by posting\nmore content on social media and getting\nmore views. You have to understand one\nthing, right? A salesunnel, it looks\nlike this. So on the top of the funnel\nis views, and you track the conversion\nrate based off of a funnel structure. If\nyou, let's say you have 1,000 views, you\nhave to track whether those 10,000 views\nactually convert to a click on your\nInstagram or Tik Tok page. Let's just\nassume they download your app. One out\nof 10 people actually pay for your app.\nThen that's a again 10% conversion rate\nfrom there. This is actually a really\ngood case by the way. Like this is great\nconversion. If you have like one paying\nuser from 1,000 views, that's really\nnice. But you have to track conversion\nrates from this. So having a good\nproduct, having a good onboarding flow,\nand having a good pay wall would\nincrease your conversion rate, right?\nBut without a proper funnel structure or\nwithout a proper good video, you're not\ngoing to get enough views to the point\nwhere those conversion rate could\nactually do its job. Right? Having a\ngood product, but nobody's going to see\nit does not make you rich. You're not\ngoing to have any users if you don't\nhave any views. But vice versa, if you\nhave a lot of views in, which I did\nbefore for my first app, but you didn't\nreally have a high converting product or\na high converting video, then it's also\nwasted views. So just remind yourself to\nhave good conversion and have good\nviews. Just keep track of those two\nKPIs. Now, let's talk about paid ads.\nThere are three types of paid ads that\nBible chat is doing. Tik Tok ads, Meta\nAds, and Google Ads. Now, these are all\npublic information. You can quite\nliterally just search Meta Ads library\nand then go on there, search Bible chat.\nYou can see every single ad campaign\nthat they're running. Same goes for\nGoogle Ads and same goes for Tik Tok\nads. How does this paid ad actually\nwork? So, it's also on a CPM basis where\nyou run a campaign with a set budget.\nSo, let's say you have $100 that you\nwant to pay Google to promote for. Um,\nyou set the niche, you put on the video,\nand you put on a campaign budget. It's\njust going to spend that $100. So,\nyou're going to see how much money you\nhave to pay per, you know, every click\nor whatever. It's a very streamlined\napproach where you can just scale a\nproduct. So, what Bible did was they\ntook those viral videos that they got\nfrom their organic content site because\nthose are just the highest converting\nformats, right? As I mentioned, they\nhave the highest views and potentially\nthe highest conversion rate. So\ntherefore, they just reuse that and then\njust throw money specifically promoting\nthis video and gaining more exposure. So\nboth the conversion rate and views are\noptimized. With a video that is easier\nto go viral, you have a lower cost of\npromoting it because in of itself, the\nvideo is good enough so that Google does\nnot have to like intentionally push it\nor meta does not have to intentionally\npush it or else it's going to be very\nexpensive. Bible chat has tested over\n800 creatives right now and are\ncurrently running about 120 of them\nlive. This is a very large scale.\nThey're probably reinvesting their\nprofits into this to scale even higher\nrevenue numbers. And for Google, they're\nrunning both Google search ads and video\nads on Google Display Network and\nYouTube Shorts. So, they have SEO\nenabled, right? When people search Bible\napp or whatever or Christian app,\nthey're the first that you're going to\nsee. And those are actually high volume\nkeywords, high traffic keywords that\nactually gets paying users. So, they're\njust optimized in every funnel possible,\nwhich is why they're able to achieve\n$300,000 in monthly ranking revenue.\nThis is extremely impressive growth.\nOkay, I finished the entire product side\nanalysis and also the marketing funnel\nanalysis. What are things that they\ncould be doing more? Well, you can\nprobably try image ads right on meta ads\nlibrary. You can test that. Uh they're\nalso slightly cheaper to run. You can\nhave more creatives just do more or even\nlike try YouTubers. Even though those\nare, you know, relatively higher in\nprices per video, they usually have a\nhigher number of conversions because\npeople who watch long form content is\nmore likely to going to purchase your\nproduct because they're just more in\ntone with you and they're they know you\na bit better. You know, there's just\nthat trust relationship behind uh the\nYouTuber and the viewers. So, you're\nprobably going to get a higher\nconversion rate based off of that. But,\nit really depends. Um I I think\ntypically B2B companies would have a big\nYouTuber campaign, but not for consumer\napps. Thank you guys so much for\nwatching this video. It's a very long\nvideo, but it's a full case study. I\nhope you guys learned something from\nthis.
