{"transcript": "[Music]\nBrett from Designjoy is this one-man\ndesigner who's making millions of\ndollars a year, but that's not the most\ninteresting part about him. The most\ninteresting part is he's using AI to\ngenerate some of the most beautiful\ndesigns I have ever seen. And Brett, by\nthe end of this episode, what will\npeople get out of it? So I think people\nwill be pretty shocked by the simple\npath it is to to arrive at like\nbeautifully generated graphics what you\nknow no matter what you're doing. Um\nthere is no kind of magic magic behind\nthe scenes all that much. These tools\nare really powerful. Long story short\nit's super easy and I think people will\nbe surprised by that. Hey you you want\n$5,000 to go build out your startup idea\ncuz I'm giving away\n$5,000. So it's a giveaway. We're doing\nit. Uh, the way to enter, super simple\nand free. So, let's go ahead and do it\nright now. Step one is like this video.\nSo, go ahead and go find that little\nlike button. Boom. Like, done. Second\nthing, comment on this video. Go to the\ncomment section. Scroll down. Oh, there\nit is. Answer, what startup would you\nwant to build with the $5,000? Don't\nknow the answer to that? That's okay.\nEven what space do you want to go build\nin? dating app, fintech app, you name\nit. And then number three, you're going\nto want to go to\nideabrowser.com. I've pinned it. Uh it's\na pinned comment. So, you can go to that\nlink, hit it, open it up, and you're\ngoing to see this website that gives\naway a free startup idea uh based on a\ntrend uh and it every single day. So,\nwe're literally dishing out free startup\nideas. This is a startup I co-founded.\num and go and sign up to it for free and\nhopefully it'll get your creative juices\nflowing. I want to give a special uh\nshout out to Bolt.new for pwning up the\n$5,000 to give to you. They're putting\ntheir money where their mouth is. A lot\nof you know Bolt.new because I've I've\nused the product a lot. Um and you know,\nbut for for for people who don't know,\nit's a AI coding tool where you write a\nfew words and software magically comes\nout of it. It's a beautiful thing. Check\nit out. bolt.new and thank you for\nsupporting the Startup Ideas podcast.\nAnd for the last giveaway, we're going\nto announce who won in a few weeks. I'm\nactually hoping I can bring them on to\nthe podcast and film their reaction. So,\nwe'll see. Hopefully, they want to come\non. Uh but excited to announce who won\nthe last $5,000 giveaway.\nsipping time, baby.\nAnd when you say easy, you know, you're\nyou're a super talented designer, so I'm\nsomeone who's I wouldn't call myself a\ndesigner. Will someone like me be able\nto create insane value out of these\ntools? That's the goal, right? Um, and\nwe'll go through this. There's\ndefinitely there's definitely levels to\nthis AI generation thing. Uh most of the\ncontent that I put out there is not\ngeared directly towards designers. It's\ngeared towards, you know, anybody with a\nwith a midjourney subscription, chat\nsubscription. So, um really don't have\nto have any prior design knowledge at\nall. Um having good taste definitely\nhelps, but aside from that, there's no\nthere's really no skill issue here at\nall if you're a non-creative. All right,\nlet's get into it. Yeah, I mean, so\nthere's a lot of different realms with\nthis AI generative AI sort of uh phase\nthat we're in right now. Um, you know,\nyou have image generation, you have\nvideo generation, you have all kinds of\ndifferent things. Um, so we'll start\nwith the top. We'll start with like the\neasiest form if you want to kind of get\nyour feet wet with this AI creation um\nthing that we're in right now. Not\nsponsored by any of these tools. These\nare just tools that I that I use in\ndifferent different sort of\ncircumstances. Um, so we'll start with\nlike the easiest, then we'll go into\nlike the realm that I play the most in.\nUm, so like if you just wanted to, for\nexample, if we're in here, essentially\nlike Higsfield is is one of those again\nyou have no experience at all. You want\nto just see how how this works. Um, so\nHigsfield is um basically all these\ntemplates that you can use, right? So we\ncan try one out if you want to. Can we\ndo that real quick? It's it's a pretty\nquick thing. So, um, one of the hardest\nparts about AI is understanding how to\ntalk to the AI and what to tell it to\nactually do. I mean, if we're doing an\nad, for example, when it comes to video,\nmost of us don't talk like a director.\nWe don't know what dolly in, dolly out,\nall that typically means. So, Higfield\nis like is coming down to our level and\ngiving us these sort of preset\nuh, actions so so to speak and effects.\nAnd so we can just take let's just take\nthis for example here and I'll show you\nhow well this works. So uh let's go\nlet's see hopefully this follows me. So\nlet's do like a liquid death can. Do you\ndrink liquid death?\nI\nI tried it. I like my water out of Yeah.\nYeah. Yeah. out of a glass bottle. You\nknow I hear you. Um that's fair. I've\nnever tried it. So I'm not neither a fan\nnor a nor a foe. So So we'll just add\nthis in. So, let's say you have a drink\ncompany or if you have anything, you\nknow, any really anything. We'll see how\nactually well this works. So, literally\nall I did was I picked a preset, right?\nUploaded a picture of a of a product and\nlet's just hit generate and see what\nhappens. So, hopefully what it should\ndo, well, actually, we've done this\nbefore, so we can we don't have to wait\nfor this. So, what it should do, um, I\nthink there's one down here that was\ninteresting. Yeah. So, it actually takes\ninto consideration the the can and the\nbranding. It could swap the model out\nand then when you play this, you know,\nit's like, oh my god, it's perfect. You\nknow, it maintains the text on the can.\nThat's one of these things like the text\nhas always been kind of the the problem\nchild of AI generation because it never\nquite got it right. Well, we're we're\npast that point now. It gets text right.\nI wasn't into liquid death before, but\nafter watching that\nvideo, I'm into liquid death. There you\ngo. There you go. Yeah. I mean it is\nquick, right? I mean the the hardest\npart about AI generation just waiting\nfor the image to generate. Um but with\nthis tool, right, you don't have to\nprompt it. It has all these presets,\nright? So this is and you have if you\nclick over here, right, this is where\nyou could prompt it if you wanted to do\nsomething very specific. Upload your\nreference photo. And then if you click\ninto here, you have again all of these\ndifferent effects, right? if I wanted to\nturn something into metal, if I wanted\nto just sort of call out different basic\ncamera controls on on certain things and\nthen it it just it just does it really\nquick. No, no, you this is like again\nlike a good early entry into AI\ngeneration. Um, now do I do a lot of\nthis? Not really. This is like it's fun\nto show and again if you have a product,\nit's a great way to create some cool\ncool like ads for Instagram and stuff\nlike that. Um, but the real fun is is\nover in the the Chad GBT midjourney side\nof things. So, Chad GBT again, all of\nthese, we'll go to midjourney for a\nmoment. Midjourney is where we generate\nthese images, right? Uh, it's not video.\nWe're going to generate if you're going\nto do video, this is where you oftent\ntimes start because you need a you need\na base initial kind of reference image\nto begin with. And so, what what's your\nGreg? Have you used Midjourney quite a\nbit or Yeah, I would say I've used it a\ndecent amount. A decent amount. Yeah.\nSo, the issue right now is you have all\nthese tools and they pop up all the\ntime, right? We have we have Cling, we\nhave Korea, we have all these different\nwe have Visual Electric, um\nFlora, there's a there's a hundred of\nthem out there. Uh I I it's easy to get\ndistracted and figure out, you know,\nshould I be trying all these tools? I\npretty much stick to like the top three\nor four of them. I keep a pulse on all\nthe other ones, but really like\nMidjourney, MidJourney and Chap GBT are\nthe two that I use by far the most. And\nI use them together in a really like\nspecial way. Um, so MidJourney is like\nphenomenal at styling, you know, if you\nwant to like this morning, for example.\nUm, I'm doing branding for a work called\nLeisure Labs, you know, and so I'm\ngenerating these these sort of like\nKodak vintage aerial photos of of a golf\ncourse, for example. Then I wanted to\nsupply a different a different sort of\nbrand direction for for like a surfer or\nsomething like that, right? Kind of on\nthat leisure leisure side of things.\num did some other stuff around around\ncreating some some buildings and stuff,\nbut it gets the styling as far as like\nthe artistic styling is hard to none\nthan than any other tool out there. So,\nthis is where I go if I want to create\nsomething really artistic. Uh chatbt on\nthe other hand is where I go if I want\nsomething very specific. So, I'll take a\nphoto here, for example, and Mid Journey\ncan sometimes get the image right if I\nwant to add in a person to this photo\nthat's like teeing off or something. Uh,\nbut you could you could tell if I were\nto zoom in on this, it it kind of it I\nmean, kind of look at that shadow,\nright? It's kind of weird. Um, and in an\nideal world, you take this into into\nchatbt and say, \"Hey, take this photo.\nJust insert an overhead shot of a\ngolfer.\" and it would it would get it\nmostly realistic, way more realistic\nthan mid Journey. So using them, knowing\nhow to use them together is is\ndefinitely key. But these systems are\nonly as good as what prompt you give\nthem or what reference image you\nprovide. So for those that haven't used\nMidJourney before, it's a very simple\nsystem. We don't need to spend 30\nminutes going undergoing how it works,\nbut you essentially have a prompt that\nyou can tell it what you want to do. And\nthen you're basically going to be using\nimage prompts and style references. So\nimage prompts for those don't that don't\nknow is if I insert a photo into here of\nthis surfer, it's going to the next\nimage it's going to generate might have\na person in it, might have a surfboard\nin it, might have, you know, sort of\nlike greenery in it. Um, if I insert a\nstyle reference, for example, this one\nright here, it's whatever image I\ngenerate, it's going to have those\ncolors, the same shadows, highlights,\ndepth of field, um, that sort of thing.\nSo you use those together in really cool\nways. And it's fun to like mix styles.\nSo, if I wanted to upload like this\norange style with this green style, you\ncan get some really cool generations\nthat are quite a bit quite surprising.\nBut again, they're only as good as the\nprompt that you provide. And so, that's\nwhere chat GBT comes in. So, it used to\nbe that that prompting was a skill and\nit and it was before GPT got as good as\nit was. knowing how to describe these\nthings that you wanted was like it\nalmost took you know like author level\nskills when it come when it came to\nwriting and describing and kind of\nvisualizing and imagining these things\nbut nowadays um prompting is not a skill\nit's it like people in the AI community\nlike to gatekeep it you know they'll say\nhere's the prompt that I wrote and\npeople like how do you think of those\nthings or or a lot of times they don't\neven share the prompt but chatbt is very\ngood at giving doing prompts. So, we can\nsee an example here. So, if I'm going to\npull up like for example, I was doing I\nwanted to do some like cowboy\nuh cowboy art, right? So, I started with\na simple thing. I want I want to write\nsome image prompts to generate a zoomed\nin photo of a cowboy in the back of a\nhorse riding the rains or holding\nholding the rains. The photo should be\nzoomed in on the hands and rains.\nbasically gives me, you know, a few\noptions for a prompt. And it does it in\na in a really well done way where I\ncould never write this stuff, right? I\ncould never think of it. Um, and if we\ngo over here to chatbt, we can actually\nsee what what these things created. Uh,\nso let me scroll down here for a moment.\nSo I used a I used a style image, a\nstyle reference of this image right\nhere. This was something that I created\nin MidJourney. Uploaded it as a style\nreference. didn't didn't upload an image\nprop because I quite frankly I have a\nprompt I don't really need that all that\nmuch. So I put it in here and got\nseveral several like really solid\noptions. Um and this is this is sort of\nin the the realm of perplexity branding\nfor those that are fans fans of it. Huge\nfan of it myself. And then you know I\nbasically just talked back to it. I said\nnow I want one zoomed in on a cowboy.\nAnd it gave me some and I was like ah\nthat's not what I wanted. I meant I want\nit I want it zoomed in on the the\ncowboy's hat. Right. So, boom. Got this\nlike amazing image. And it's it's right\nin line with this. And I kept that\ngoing. You know, I was like, uh, now I\nwant one zoomed in on the c on the on\nthe horse's face. Boom. Done. Uh, and\nthen, you know, one that was zoomed out\nshowing some mountains in the\nenvironment. And all I'm saying is\nmountains in the same environment. And\nit's like adding in all of this extra\nlike rich detail that really makes the\nimage what it is. So I'm just over here.\nAnd then you could say like you could\neven tell JTBT say, \"Hey, I want to\ncreate a collection of these as posters.\nGive me some different scenes that tie\nback to the to the same, you know,\ninitial prompt, but have different\nelements in different environments.\" And\nit'll just dream up all these\ncollections. You don't have to say like\na zoomed-in photo of the horse, a zoomed\nin photo of this, or whatever. you can\nlet it kind of dream and imagine for you\nwhich is really cool. So this is the\nstarting point for really good generated\nuh you know AI art is actually\nconstructing a good prompt and then you\ntake that into here you know you plug in\na style image and boom you're you know\nyou're done at this point if you want to\ndo that and you can see I've done this\nyou know been doing this with different\nworlds and and this is my latest sort of\ntutorial is on these sort of like you\nknow isometric 3D you know worlds that\nwe bring into runway and add motion to\nthem which we can go through But it's\nreally not that complex. You have to\nbasically have a very basic idea of what\nyou want. Prompt that in chat GPT. Say,\n\"Hey, make me a prompt around this idea\nor make me several and take those and\njust start plugging in the midjourney.\nFind a style that you want.\" Like\nPinterest is phenomenal for this. It's\nall I use to generate, you know,\nstylistic directions. I'll come on that.\nIt may not have anything related to what\nI want to do, but it may be like the\nright style, the right like 3D art, or\nthere might the right kind of like\nfeeling and vibe. And I upload as a\nstyle im style reference, plug in my\nprompt, and you just kind of just like\nat that point, it's just fun to sit back\nand see what what's created, you know.\nUm, but yeah, that's that's sort of like\nthat's the the second tier of of AI\ngeneration is using CHP and Midourney\ntogether in that way. And then of\ncourse, you can take these and throw\nthem into runway and add motion to them.\nYou can bring them into Photoshop and do\ngenerative to fill. You can you can do\nall kinds of things. You can throw them\ninto\nmagnific upscaler to really get all\nthese like super rich details. Um which\nI've done in several of my tutorials. So\nyou then you start kind of leveling all\nthese tools on and that's where you get\nthis really dope stuff that is, you\nknow, hard to replicate unless you know\nhow to how to use them in tandem with\neach other. Um, I mean even even this,\nso the stuff that I'm seeing on the\nscreen and I've seen some of this on\nyour ex, you know, I think a lot of\npeople saw these beautiful images and\nwere like bookmark and like, but I can\nnever do that because Brett is a\ndesigner. He's like been studying this\nfor years. He's a practitioner. He's he\nmade millions of dollars, you know,\ndoing design work. Therefore, yeah, I'll\nsee you later tutorial, aka bookmark.\nBut deep down, I think a lot of people\nare like, I can never do it. I'd be\nhappy to show you. We can do one in like\nwe can do one of these scenes, for\nexample, from scratch in in, you know, 5\nto 6 minutes. It's not hard, right? Like\ngoing through the process of like you\ncan see this for example, right? This\nbeautiful image here. All I did was I\nwent on Pinterest. I found a picture of\na cabin, right? which was Let's see if\nthis loads up. Um, of course it's not\ngoing to\nload. Ah. Um, right here.\nBoom. Yeah. Found a picture of a cabin.\nThis was not AI generated. This was just\nsimply pulled from a Pinterest uh a\nPinterest search. Had a reference image\nhere, which was this one here, a style\nimage that I have saved. I keep these\nlike in folders in my in my computer, so\nI have all these different styles that I\ncan just reference back and forth. And\nso yeah, it's going to create this cabin\nwith the style of these mountains. And\nthen you can see where you know pulling\nin this color here. But then this this\nsort of object is is get gets placed\nhere with this simple very simple\nprompt. And then you go over to runway,\nyou upload this picture, you give it a\nprompt which you create with chatbt. You\ngo to chatbt say hey here's the image\nthat I want to turn into a video. Give\nme a prompt that would tell runway what\nwhat like what exactly to move. And\nit'll come back and it'll give you,\nyeah, put soft ripples in the water,\nhave the smoke coming, have the trees\nblowing softly in the wind, but like\ntell it to you very eloquently and like\nsophisticated. And then you just press\ngenerate and you sit back, wait for it\nto generate, and boom, like 5 minutes\nlater, you have a beautiful a beautiful\nvideo. Then you can even take that\nfurther. You can go over to cling. You\nknow, Cling is another image to video\ntool um that allows start and end frame,\nwhich means that you can loop it. So,\nthe video will start and end with the\nsame frame and and Cling will just fill\nin the the in between. So, that if you\nhad like a an icon that you wanted to\nput on your site and you wanted to kind\nof endlessly loop or it wasn't this\nharsh reset, you just set the start\nframe and end frame to the same image\nand it just infinitely loops. And then\nonce that's generated, then it has a\nlittle button that says AI sound and\nit'll take into context the video and\ngive you sound options that are AI\ngenerated. So you can I mean you can go\nand then if you wanted to right these\nthese these prompt tools are limited to\nabout 10 seconds per video. You can go\nto the end video, right click on your\nyour computer, save the last frame as an\nimage, upload that as the next video. So\nthe the next video will start at the\nlast frame of your last video and have a\ncontinuous shot for as long as you want\nand then stitch them together with a\nwith a simple video editing tool that\nyou don't have to have really any\nexperience doing. You're just dragging\nclips onto a timeline and exporting. So\nit's not it's not really that it's not\nreally that complicated when you when\nyou look at it this way. Could we look\nat some of the the more complex runways\nor you know Yeah. Do you want to Should\nwe like just for the sake of this just\ndo one of these? Yeah. So, let's do um\nlet's pick an image here. Which one do\nwe like? Like I like this one. Oh, yeah.\nThis one's cool. So, what I would do I\ncould probably describe the movement\nbecause I've done this a 100 times\ncreating a creating a tutorial, right?\nUm, but we're just going to throw this\nin here and we're going to tell it we\ndon't have to be we don't have to be\nsophisticated in the way we we talk to\nCHPT. It it can understand very little\nand expand upon it. So, I'm going to use\nrunway to add motion to this image. Give\nme a\nprompt. Okay. So, it's going to\nunderstand it's not even just going to\nunderstand it. Well, it's going to\nunderstand what you want to do, but it's\neven going to understand the tool that\nyou're going to use so that it writes it\na certain way. Because if I were to say\nlike I want to use this up at put up at\nmidjourney for something, it's going to\ngive you like the style parameters and\nall these sorts of tags at the end. But\nsince it's runway, we just need very\nkind of a text format. So, we'll head\nover to\nrunway. And this is just one of many\nmany of these tools. Cling, Korea, all\nof them do it. Uh Runway is is certainly\non the upper echelon of like quality.\nUm, so we'll just upload a we'll upload\nan asset here that we have already\ngenerated\nbefore. Let that upload and then so\nthat's our image. We're going to just\npaste the prompt in here. Let me read\nread through this real quick. Just make\nsure that software is okay. Keep the\nkeep the camera completely still for a\npiece. See it even get it even\nunderstands that. So there's not this\nall this movement around. And of course\nyou could tweak all this, right? Then\nwe're going to have the aspect ratio\njust be square. Uh, we'll do 10 seconds.\nLike I said, it's generally five to 10\nseconds. We'll let that we'll let that\nrun. Why did you choose square versus\nanother format? Well, so I'm sh I'm\ntypically sharing these on X. Uh, I like\nportrait media for for the most, but\nwhen you're sharing a video on X, it'll\nadd black borders to the side of it. I\ndon't like that. I hate it. It kind of\nruins the aesthetic for me. So square is\nthe square is the best. Now, if you\nwanted to share something super\ncinematic,\nuh, you do like 16 by9. But u I like\nsquare because you it's it's bigger on\nyour screen. It catch it's going to\ncatch your eye far more. Um and one\nother thing I'll say about all this and\nthis goes for\nchatbt not chatbt as much. It usually\nnails things um midjourney and runway\nand all these tools. They're far from\nperfect. You know, I've done, for\nexample, I was trying to do a 3D logo uh\nrotate like on a on an axis and it like\ngot halfway and then just some cartoon\ncharacter popped out of it and I'm like,\n\"What the heck? Where did that come\nfrom?\" So, they're they could be a\nlittle finicky. So, you have to you have\nto kind of understand what it's going to\nbe good at and what it's what it might\ndo some weird things and and just adjust\nyour prompts accordingly. So, we'll do\nthis. It might nail it, but it might\nalso have like a weird zoom in on it.\nAnd so we'll have to readjust things. We\nwon't do this for the video, but you\nthere might be some weird artifacts or\nsomething like that that you that you\nnotice and you just have to kind of redo\nit, reprompt it if you need to and kind\nof keep trying. But and while this is\nuploading, I'm curious your perspective\non this. So this podcast is called the\nStartup Ideas Podcast. It's generally\npeople who want to build startup ideas\nand and quit their job or do a side\nhustle or something like that. What does\nthis whole world of, you know, AI\ndesigning or vibe designing enable\nfor, you know, for these people and what\nare some opportunities that you can\nthink of that, um, you think will will\nbe very lucrative? Yeah, I mean there's\nthere's what's capable today which is\nagain like a lot of what's being shared\nout there is is really more on just like\nthe fun creative side kind of just you\nknow testing these tools out generating\nthings that aren't quite used every day\nin the actual design world more more\nthan just like a Twitter post you know\nsharing a tutorial but uh I think the\nbiggest opportunity right now for\ncreatives is is really on the branding\nside you know there the the web design\nside hasn't really had its day in AI\nquite yet. It's on its way with tools\nlike Bolt and Lovable and all these, but\nthe output's pretty mediocre, right?\nUm, branding is, you know, is amazing.\nSo, if I if for example what I can do\nfor you, Greg, if if you wanted to hire\nme to design like a leisure, you know,\nleisure brand like I was describing,\nright? I can go into midjourney over\nhere. I can as your designer or even\nyou, you know, once you once you find\none asset that you really like, you can\ngo into mid Journey, you can actually\nset up a mood board. Have you ever done\nthis before or seen this before? No.\nYeah. So, you can set up a mood board,\nright? And I set up a mood board for\nthese for these cowboy images. Now,\nanything that I want to do at this point\nin time, I can use this this code as a\nprompt, and it's going to reference back\nto all of this here. And so, it gives\nyou the ability to basically create\ncontent that's that's that that's relate\nthat relates to one another. There's\ncontinuity between the content and and\nit's it's uh what's the what's the word\nI'm looking for? Consistent, right? Um\nso I could give either I could give this\nto you and then you could basically if\nyou if you have, you know, this is a\nbackground or whatever for social media\npost or whatever it is, you have the\nability to then begin to kind of\nreplicate that at very fast paces and\nit's all going to be kind of cohesive.\nUm there's little things like it's not\ngood at logo design right now. you can't\nreally like generate the entire brand\nusing it. It's not text isn't perfect.\nVe, it doesn't do vector art, you know,\nthings like that. So, you still need a\ndesigner for some of those pieces. But\nonce those pieces are set, the ability\nfor you to take those references and\ncontinue to build new additional\ncreatives um off of it is really really\nwhere the opportunity is today. I think\nthat'll get even crazier as times go on,\nespecially with the website side of\nthings and like that sort of thing. But\nbranding is really the biggest the\nbiggest leverage point at this point\nwhen it comes to AI and the ability to\njust generate consistent assets, you\nknow, at a very quick pace.\nUm, yeah, that's that, you know,\nobviously outside of that, Chad GP and\nstuff can be used for all kinds of\nthings when it comes to startups, but\nthe actual design piece that that's\nreally where that's really where the\nmajority of the of the opportunity is at\nthis point in time. Let's go back to\nthis and see if it did it. So, we'll\nplay this and hope hopefully we cross\nour fingers and it it just nails it. put\nthat in a museum. You know what I mean?\nRight. And then what's crazier? Okay, we\ncan we can sit down here and we can say\nupscale to 4K and we just click it and\nit just does it. You know, now we have a\n4K a 4K video. And then what's crazy is\nyou can you can take this I can right\nclick on this and save a video frame. I\ncan bring this back over here to here\nand say, \"Hey, runway, you know, uh or\nor chatbt or or midjourney.\" Like\npretend as if you're a a real estate\nphotographer.\nand I need different different angles of\nthis building shot for for a a listing\nor a magazine or something like that and\nit can get into that role and and take\nthis reference and and take different\nshots of it. Then you could throw those\ninto runway, add the same motion we just\ndid, stitch them together in one video\nand then you have this amazing, you\nknow, multi-frame, multi- scene scene\nvideo very quickly. So, it's pretty it's\npretty uh it's pretty amazing. I would\nimagine the use case for a lot of these\nvideos is going to be ads. Yes. Um, how\nwould you if I wanted to put text on top\nof these videos? Is that possible? Yeah.\nSo, text on top. So, you it does require\nit. There's certain things where you\nwant to branch off, right? Like you\ncould tell runway to do that. It may get\nit, but if it doesn't, it's slightly\noff. You can't just like use your mouse\npointer to like move it, right? It's\nembedded in the video. So, this is where\nI would I would say this video, use a\nvery userfriendly\num video platform like Cap Cut where\nyou're just going to drag this in and\nthen drag a text layer on top and you're\ndone. You can position however you want.\nYou don't have to have any video\nexperience at all to do that. Very\nsimple. Takes, you know, 5 seconds. So,\nthere that's where there are certain\npoints where you do want to use\ntraditional tools to get to get those\nthings quite right. Um, but again, like\nChad GBT does a good job of that, but\nChad does doesn't do video really. They\nhave Sora, but it's really poor output.\nBut yeah, just like I was doing stuff\nthis morning for an e-commerce shop, and\nthey have their products on set on these\nlike cool background images and stuff,\nand so I was just generating all kinds\nof psychedelic weird like background\nimages. Um, yeah, it's it's it's a\ncreative person's dream, but it's\ndefinitely fun, even if you're a\nnon-creative, to be able to just\ngenerate something as beautiful as this.\nlike you could never have done anything\nremotely close to this. I'm a creative\nand I could have never done anything\nremotely close to this um for the rest\nof my career most likely, but now I can\ndo it in 5 minutes. Um Brett, this has\nbeen eyeopening. Um I'm getting my hands\ndirty literally right after this. Um\nthank you for coming on. I'm going to\ninclude uh where to find Brett and\nfollow his tutorials in the show notes\nso people can go and follow him there.\nBrett, is there anything uh you want to\nleave people with or say?\nYeah. No, I mean, like I said, get like\nwhat you're going to do, get your hands\ndirty. Utilize Chatb2 to help you talk\nto these AI tools. Uh and and know which\nones are good at different things. But\nyeah, mostly just get your hands dirty.\nDon't don't stress about there being too\nmany tools. Like pick a couple that\nyou're that you like. Stick with them,\nlearn how they work. Um, yeah, you can\ndo you can do really remarkable things\nwith very little effort, which I think\nis the is the coolest part about AI and\nsomething not a lot of people want to\nsay or admit. You know, I think there's\na there's a a level of gatekeep keeping\nthis around this sort of stuff and and\nmy goal is just to kind of break down\nthose barriers and show pretty much\nanybody can do this sort of stuff. So,\nyeah, that's it. Well, I appreciate\nthat. Like, this is sauce as far as I'm\nconcerned. this is like good sauce that\nyou're sharing and and you demystify\nthis for thousands of people watching\nand it's going to make a difference in\ntheir lives 100%. So, thank you for\nsharing your knowledge and being here\nand being so generous. Of course, my\npleasure. Thanks for having me on, Brett\nfrom Design Joy.\nThis.", "language": "en-US", "title": "Making $2,800/day with AI Design Agents (Runway + Midjourney)"}
