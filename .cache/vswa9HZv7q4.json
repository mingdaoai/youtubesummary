{"transcript": "To me, this strategy I I mean, I've\ntraded all kinds of option strategies\nfrom straddles, strangles, iron, condor,\nevery damn thing I trade. Okay? And to\nme, this is my favorite because to me,\nit is it is almost the holy grail of\ntrading. All right? I always say that\nthere are a lot of great trading\nstrategies out there, not just what I\nthought. There are many, right? But if\nyou don't manage your money properly uh\nwith proper position sizing and risk\nmanagement, any good trading strategy\ncan blow up your account if you are too\naggressive. All right. But if you're not\ngreedy, if you learn to be conservative,\nyou can you can actually do very very\nwell. Could you share some of your\nbiggest winners and your biggest losers\nin terms of your investments? Uh\nPalanteer so far has uh more than 10x.\nNvidia also more than 10x. If you look\nat the last 70 80 years in the market,\nright, 78% of all years was bullish.\n78%. 22% are bearish. So if you think\nabout it, every time you short the\nmarket, your odds of making money is\n22%. I'm sure you already know by now,\nthis year has been a little bit tough\nfor the stock market. With all the talks\nabout trade wars, tariffs, and even the\npotential of a recession, the market did\nhit correctional territory in early\nApril. And the golden question everyone\nis asking right now is, should I still\nbuy the dip? What if the dip just keeps\non dipping? And what if this time is\nactually different? Well, our guest\ntoday believes otherwise, that this time\nis not any different, and he's buying\nmore stocks. According to him, this is\nhow you make millions in the stock\nmarket. Adam Coup is an award-winning\nSingaporean entrepreneur, best-selling\nauthor, and a professional investor, and\nan options trader. He's also one of the\nmost watched financial mentors on\nYouTube with his channel clocking in\nover 55 million video views and over 2\nmillion subscribers. Our conversation\ntoday with Adam Coup couldn't have come\nat a better timing. With so much\nuncertainty going on in the markets this\nyear, the Humble Traders podcast is here\nto help. In our conversation with Adam\ntoday, you're going to learn his\ninsights on where the market is going\nthis year. Are we heading towards a\nrecession, and is this time actually\ndifferent? Adam's approach to long-term\ninvesting, how he selects the stocks to\ntrade, the criteria he looks for, and\nhow he executes his entries, risk\nmanagement, and taking profit. Last but\nnot least, we're going to learn about\nhow he uses option strategies to hedge\nand trade around his investments in\norder to generate income. How he also\nstays calm while managing a 4.6 million\nportfolio. Look, I understand nobody\ncould actually predict where the market\nis going, but I got to say there's just\nbeen so much doom and gloom these days\nin the market and the news, and I\npersonally want some voice of reason and\nrationality.\nSo, I flew all the way here to Singapore\nto make this podcast happen. So,\nremember to hit the like button down\nbelow and let's get ready for an\ninsightful conversation about the stocks\nand the state of the market with Adam\nCoup.\nAdam, let's start with a question that\neveryone has in mind right now. Sure. Is\nthe bottom in on the market? What do you\nthink? Uh as always you can never\npredict 100% because there are so many\nmoving parts you have no idea what Trump\nwill do when he wakes up. But based on\nthe technical analysis I I think yes I\nthink we have more or less bottomed.\nOkay. Right. Yeah. So do you think right\nnow is a good time to buy more stocks\nthat you've been eyeing or is it a\nbetter time to kind of wait and hold off\nand see kind of see what happens like a\nlot of people are talking about. Well,\nit was a better time last week, right?\nAnd I was adding I was adding last week,\nright? So I always tell people that\nthere's no best time to buy because you\nnever know where's the bottom, right?\nBut there's always a good time to buy\nand there are many good times. So to me\nas an investor, as long as the price is\nbelow the intrinsic value and it's at a\nsupport level, it's a good time. Yeah.\nOf course, after you add it at a support\nlevel undervalued, it could break\nsupport and get even more undervalued.\nYou never know, right? So if that\nhappens, then it's another good time. So\nI always average in my positions. So\nthat's the difference between like\ninvesting and trading. So for investing\nit's averaging in slowly, right? Trading\nis I just so I do trade as well. So for\ntrades I enter a trade uh at a potential\nreversal or bottom and of course my stop\nloss is there and profit target is\nthere. If I can stop down I wait for the\nnext bullish reversal. Then I enter\nagain with another stop loss there. So\nthe the key in trading is to enter at\npotential reversals at potential\nbottoms. You never know, it could break\nthe stop, right? But for investing\nagain, I I average in these positions.\nSo, it sounds like from what you just\nsaid, trading involves a little bit more\nprecision precision with your entries\nand exits and investing. Is it true that\nit sounds a little bit more forgiving\nand very I mean, investing is very\nforgiving. Yeah, absolutely. Right. I\nmean, provided you invest in very very\nvery safe companies, which is which is\nwhat I do. So I only invest in companies\nthat are very high quality, very\nconsistent growth in revenue, free cash\nflow, they are undervalued, high uh\nreturn on capital. So these companies\nare ones where I know 99% of the time\nthey're going to be higher in 5 to 10\nyears. Okay? Right? But short-term they\ncould go anywhere, right? So as long as\nyou're patient, you got holding power,\nit's almost impossible to lose money\nwhen you invest in great companies, a\nportfolio of them. All right? Of course,\na single company can can get into\ntrouble like like Boeing or Disney. You\nnever know, right? I see. But when you\nbuy a portfolio of at least 10 or 20\ngreat companies, uh cumulatively it's\nimpossible to lose money over the long\nrun. That's good to hear. Um I think\nobviously before last week there was a\nlot a lot of doom and gloom, a lot of\ntalks in the media about how this year\nis different. It's always different.\nThat's what it's always different. We're\nheading into a recession. how the market\nfor 2025 we're going to go lower. So I'm\nglad you are providing a little bit more\ncalm and rationality right now. Yeah. So\nbefore we dive into the nitty-gritty\ndetails, you're well well known online\non YouTube and of course in Singapore,\nbut for the a lot of my viewers who\ndon't know about you yet, could you tell\nus who are you? What kind of investor or\ntrader you are and what's your\nexperience been like in the market?\nOkay, so uh I started investing at 17\nyears old. So now I'm I'm just I just\nturned 51. So since I started I've been\nthrough all kinds of styles right so in\nmy early years I did a lot more trading\nthan investing one reason is because I\nguess my capital was smaller so smaller\ncapital you're more thinking how do I\ngrow it faster right so that time I\nfocus on uh a lot of uh forex trading\nday trading swing trading I traded\nstocks CFDs you name it I traded it then\nover the years as my capital grew um\nthen I started to focus more on\ninvesting and I still do trading cuz I\nlove it. It's a lot of fun. Um but I do\nmore nondirectional trading than\ndirectional trading. So today I would\nsay about\nuh yeah about 85% of my portfolio are\ninvestments uh long-term investments of\ngreat companies I buy. So I only focus\non highquality companies that I buy when\nthey are undervalued. Right? So 85% is\nthat right? And the rest would be\ntrading. uh and most of the trading I do\nis using options. Oh okay. And uh like\nmost people in the early days I focus on\noption buying. So I thought that you\nknow I was bullish on a stock I buy a\ncall. If I'm bearish I buy a put right\nand then I realized that over the long\nrun that method\num the odds are against you because you\nknow when you buy an option options are\ndecaying assets. Okay. Okay. So, every\nday you hold the option is losing money,\nlosing money, losing money. And when you\nbuy an option, you can only make money\nif the price goes up significantly. All\nright? If the price goes up slowly or\ngoes sideways or goes down, you lose\nmoney. So, when you buy options is like\nbuying the lottery. Once in a while, you\ncan make a lot of money, but more often\nthan not, you're going to lose money.\nSo, that's what happened to me in the in\nthe early days, right? So, I made a lot\nand then suddenly I lost it all. So I\nwas very frustrated and I said, \"Okay,\nif I'm losing all this money, who's\nmaking all the money? The the person\nmaking all the money is the guy selling\nme the options?\" So then I realized that\nthe way institutional option traders\nmake money consistently for their banks\nis by selling options, not buying\noptions. So that's when I had this big.\nSo I would say, yeah, for the last uh\nnine years, I focus mainly on option\nselling. So I sell and I would say out\nof the options I sell 99% are selling\nput options on good company. So I sell\ncash secure put put options and uh\nsometimes if I if I want to trade stocks\nthat are maybe more speculative okay not\nuh ones that I want to own a shares then\nI'll do what we call credit spreads I\nsee where I'll sell boo spreads right\nsell a put and buy another put to\nprotect the first put and then I do\nanother type called jade lizards right\nuh which is another uh way of credit\nselling yeah so yeah mainly that that\nthat's what I do so 85% investing and\n15% trading a lot of it options on the\nsell side and for my 85% of investing uh\nis further broken down into mainly I\nwould say about 65% capital gain\ninvesting in the US markets okay and the\nrest will be more dividend investing\nwhere I focus on yield I invest in uh\nSingapore listed REITs uh dividend\nstocks uh private credit and and bonds\noh so it seems Seems that you have a lot\nof experience not just as an investor\nbut also as a trader as well. Yeah,\nthat's how I started many different\nthings. Yeah. So, so in the early days I\nI was very much using technical\nanalysis. A lot of technicals, a lot of\ntechnicals. Um and today when it comes\nto investing, I would say it's it's 90%\nfundamentals and 10% technicals. Oh,\nokay. Um did you have any mentor figures\nin investing or trading that got you\nstarted in the early stages? Not\npersonally. Uh so I I modeled very much\nso my style is very much modeled against\nuh Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Charlie\nManga when it comes to the fundamental\npart of it. Uh for the technical part of\nit I modeled very much uh Victor\nSparandio. Okay. Uh who was I don't know\nif if you've heard of Victor Spendio. He\nwas very big in the 80s. Uh he wrote two\nuh two of some of two great books on\ntrading. Uh one is called methods of a\nwall street master. Okay. And the other\none is uh principles of professional\nspeculation. So he was one of the\ngreatest wall street traders in the 80s\nand 90s. Uh so yeah so I would say that\na lot of what I know about technical\nanalysis actually came from Victor\nSpandio. what were some of his main\nprinciples that you learned and you\nstill apply to today? Uh trend\nidentifications of trend and trend\nreversals. So one of the most powerful\nthings I learned about him was uh\nwhatever market okay uh you look at the\nuh 50 and 150 simple day uh simple\nmoving average. Okay, to determine your\nmedium-term trend. So basically if the\n50 is above the 150 simple moving\naverage, you're on a very clear uptrend.\nI see. All right. Right? And when the 50\ncrosses below the 150 with the moving\naverages sloping down, it's a confirmed\ndowntrend. So, one of the things that I\nI learned about that is not just, you\nknow, people talk about moving average\ncrossovers a lot, right? But that\ndoesn't work unless you look at the\nslope of the moving averages. Since the\nlows of early April, it seems like the\nmarkets have staged a strong V-shaped\nrecovery. As you can see here, the S&P\n500 has been steadily trending up in\nlarge parts driven by optimism around a\n90-day tariff pause between the US and\nChina and positive momentum in trade\nnegotiations. In trending markets like\nthese, some traders turn to specific\ntools like leverage ETFs to potentially\nmagnify their returns. Leverage ETFs may\nprovide a way to capture outsiz exposure\nto index moves or even hedge a portfolio\nall without the use of a margin account.\nSo for example, if the S&P 500 rises 5%\nin a single day, a 2x leverage ETF could\ndeliver up to 10% in gains. Beta Pro by\nGlobal X is Canada's largest provider of\nleverage inverse and inverse leverage\nETFs. Now for some big news. You can get\neven more daily leverage in Canada than\never before. These new Beta Pro ETFs\nprovide 3x daily long and short exposure\nto two of the most followed equity\nbenchmarks in the world for\nsophisticated traders. Beta Pro by\nGlobal X is offering 3x leverage and\ninverse leverage ETFs for the S&P 500\nand the NASDAQ 100. And here's what\nmakes them truly stand out. Global X is\nrebating the management fee by 50 basis\npoints until December 31st, 2025, making\nthem the lowest cost ETFs of their kind\nin the world at 65 basis points until\nend of the year. It's important to\nremember leverage ETFs are powerful\ntools, but they also carry unique risks,\nespecially in volatile or choppy\nmarkets. While they may enhance daily\ngains, they can also magnify daily\nlosses and experience decay if trends\nreverse. They're only to be used as\ndaily trading tools as their leverage\nresets daily and are not recommended to\nhold longer than one day. Always do your\ndue diligence by understanding the\nprospectus and ETF facts. Confirm your\nrisk tolerance and capacity for risk or\nspeak with a financial adviser before\nmaking leverage inverse and inverse\nleverage ETFs as part of your trading\nstrategies. To learn more about these\nnew products, check out the links down\nbelow. So what Victor talked about is\nthat the slope is as important as the\ncrossover. Like if you look at the 200\nday moving average, right? A lot of\npeople think that okay, if the price\ngoes above the 200 day, you're in a\nlong-term uptrend. It's very bullish.\nNo. Okay. So there are many times the\nprice goes above the 200 day and then\ngoes back below the 200 day. So the\nimportant thing is that 200 day has to\nslope up for the trend the uptrend to be\nconfirmed. Same thing when price breaks\nbelow the 200 day people say, \"Oh my\ngod.\" All right. No. Many times if the\nprice breaks below the 200 day but the\n200 day is sloping up the trend is still\nup right so the 200 has to slope down so\nthat was one of the key things I I\nlearned back then and you would apply\nthat in your investing as well as\ntrading uh not so much in okay so in the\nin my in the old days I used to when I\ninvest I look at okay great company\nundervalued and I only wanted to buy on\nan uptrend. Oh I see. All right. So in\nall this if I look at a great company\nundervalued but on a downtrend I'll not\ntouch it. I'll say okay I'll wait for\nthe uptrend. Okay. So only on an uptrend\nI will get in\nwhich which worked well. I I made good\nmoney but I realized that by the time\nthe uptrend was confirmed the price is\nalready up like 25 30% from the bottom.\nYes. Okay. So I said to myself that if\nI'm investing for the long run, I'm in\nthis company for several years, you\nknow, does it matter if I buy on a\ndowntrend and it gets a bit lower, it\ndoesn't really matter, right? Because\nit's better to buy as slow as you can so\nyou capture a lot more upside. So\nbecause of that today, even if it's on a\ndowntrend, I'll still buy it. But of\ncourse, I won't just blindly buy it on a\ndowntrend. I want to see signs of a\nreversal. So as we know that on a\ndowntrend, you have got what we call the\nimpulsive wave down pattern, right? wave\ndown then wave up wave down wave up. So\nobviously on a downtrend if it's waving\nup you don't get in right because after\na wave up you get in it could wave down\nagain. Yeah. So on a downtrend I always\nwait for what we call a parabolic drop.\nSo price must drop very rapidly. Yeah.\nCapitulation.\nOkay. And if it drops rapidly to a very\nstrong support that I identify on a\nhigher time frame. Okay. So normally I\nwould enter on a daily time frame.\nRight. Yeah, but if I if I see there's a\nstrong support on the weekly or the\nmonthly time frame, strong support\nthere, and price drops 90° very sharp\nand then I see a very strong bullish\ncandle like a bullish engulfing or pin\nbar, I'll add even before the uptrend is\nconfirmed or better still, I wait for a\ndouble bottom, a a nice double bottom\npattern, then I enter. So, so that's how\nI combine my fundamentals with the\ntechnicals I I've used before. Oh, yeah.\nYeah. So, I get in a lot So, I get in a\nlot earlier than waiting for the\nuptrend, you know. I see. Okay. Wow. So,\nso even for your long-term investments,\nyou you still use the technicals that\nbecause on my channel, a lot of the\nviewers are traders. So what you just\nsaid about technical analysis, support,\npin bars, parabolics to a downside\nreversals, these are the terms that a\nlot of traders use and they utilize that\nfor to find the entries. Yeah. So I\nguess since you also have a previous\ntrading background and you kind of\nutilize what worked for you for your\nentry style and what you learned from\nthe books and you apply that to your\ninvestments to find better entries for\nyourself. Yeah. And I also use it for my\noptions trades as well. Yeah. So if I\nsee a strong reversal pattern then I\nwould sell credit spreads. I'll sell put\noptions. Below that support. Yeah.\nAmazing. So let's talk about some of\nyour option strategies now. What's the\npurpose of uh trading options with your\nyou have your long-term investment\nportfolio and you also said you trade\noptions almost daily. What's the purpose\nof that? and how much are you trading in\nterms of options versus your long-term\nportfolio? Okay, so okay, first of all,\nI'm a very very very conservative\nperson. Extremely conservative. Uh I\ndon't use any leverage, zero zero\nleverage. And in my investment\nportfolio, I would say\num\nyeah, I would say less than 10%\nI would I would use I would use uh for\noptions less than I could use actually a\nlot more but I use less than 10%. I'm\njust very conservative and I guess one\nreason is once you accumulate a certain\namount of wealth you become more\nconservative because you don't need to\ntake so much risk anymore, right? I\nguess if I was younger with less money,\nI would be more aggressive. I like okay,\nyou know, uh 50% options or 60%, right?\nBut as you grow older and your capital\ngets bigger, it's like, you know, why\ntake the risk, right? 10%. So, yeah, so\nprobably less than 10%. And the main\npurpose of of the options is to create\nextra income for my investment\nportfolio. All right? And to increase\nthe returns, obviously, because as a\nlong-term investor, how do you grow your\nwealth? capital gain and dividends,\nright? And most of the companies that I\nbuy, the dividends are very low. You\nknow, your Nvidia and like the tech\nstocks. Yeah. Very low dividends, right?\nSo mainly it's capital gains. But you\nknow that the stock will not go up in a\nstraight line. Okay. There will be\nperiods when it goes through\nconsolidations, periods when it goes on\na downtrend. So in those periods, how do\nyou create extra income while waiting\nfor it to go up later, right? So that's\nwhere options come in. All right? So, so\nmy favorite strategy is selling uh cash\nsecured puts. All right. So, basically,\nas you know, when you buy a put option,\nit's like buying insurance.\nSo, I'm the guy who's selling insurance\nto people. I'm like the insurance\ncompany. So, I sell insurance and I\ncollect premium. So, I only do it on\nagain very safe quality companies. For\nexample, you look at Apple for example.\nSo, um you know, I can't remember right\nnow. I think Apple's trading about 200\nbucks something like that. about $190\n$200 right now around there. So first\nthing is um so I think Apple's a pretty\nsafe company and uh so my intrinsic\nvalue for Apple is about\nuh one 180 right there about 180 right\nokay so what I do is first I wait for a\nwave down pattern I must see a drop in\nthe price right so if Apple drops be uh\nnear the intrinsic value or below it so\nlet's say Apple drops to 180 okay okay\nbelow that 190 price okay yeah drops to\nlet's say 190 180 um then as you know\nwhen price drops volatility increases in\nthe market the the VIX goes up right\nokay so at 190 sorry at 180 could I buy\nthe shares yeah I could if I wanted to\nright nothing wrong but what I do is I I\nplay hard to get so I sell a put option\nat say about 170 strike price I see so\nwhen I sell a put option at 170 strike\nprice I collect a premium okay and I am\nnow obligated to buy the shares at 170\nwhich is a strike price if it gets\nthere. Yeah. Okay. So, what happens is\nthat I normally sell about 30 to 45 days\nto expiration. That's that's what I do.\nSo, in the next 30 to 45 days, what\nhappens if Apple goes up? If Apple goes\nsideways or Apple goes down uh but\ndoesn't go below 170, the options become\nworthless. Now even if the price goes\nbelow 170 it doesn't matter but by\nexpiration it needs to be at 170 or\nabove in all these scenarios the options\nwill be worthless and I and I collect\npremium so it's kind of like collecting\nfree money every month. Oh okay. And the\nonly what's the downside? Okay. So the\ndownside Okay. So the downside is if if\nApple drops below 170 and stays below\n170. I see. By the expiration if I don't\ndo anything then the options will be\nexercised automatically and I'll be\nassigned 100 shares of Apple at 170. Oh\nthat's a pretty good deal. You said you\nwant to be willing to own the stock as\nwell. Which is a pretty good deal. But\nremember that when I sell the the put\noption, I collect premium up front,\nwhich let's say I collect, example, $4\nin premium, right? So I already have the\n$4. So if I buy Apple at 170 minus $4,\nso that's a 164. So my net my net\npurchase price is 164, which means I'm\nbuying Apple at a discount. So when you\nsell a put option, you either get free\nmoney or you buy the shares at a\ndiscount. Okay? Now, at the last moment,\nif I disc if I uh if I say I don't want\nthe shares, you know what? I I don't\nfeel like buying the shares anymore.\nNow, what I could do is I just buy back\nthat put option I sold at a loss, right?\nCuz I sold the put and but now that the\nprice drop, the put is now trading at a\nhigher price. So, I have to buy the put\nback at a loss now. Okay. To close the\nposition. So, once I buy the put back,\nI'm no longer obligated to buy the\nshares. Right. But I I make a loss,\nright? Yeah. Then what I do is I\nsimultaneously sell another put option\nat the same strike price or lower. So\nnow maybe I sell the put at instead of\n170 I sell at say 165. Okay, with a\nfurther expiration date another 45 days\nand then I collect a new set of premium\nto cover the loss of that old put. So we\ncall this rolling the put down. So by\nrolling the put I delay owning the\nshares but I reduce my strike price from\n170 to 165. So now I need to buy the\nshares at 165, no longer 170, right? Uh\nand then and then I keep repeating this.\nI I keep repeating this until the option\nexpires worthless. Okay? And to me, this\nstrategy I I mean, I've traded all kinds\nof option strategies from straddles,\nstrangles, iron, condor, every damn\nthing I've trade. Okay? And to me, this\nis my favorite because to me, it is it\nis almost the holy grail of trading\nbecause you can't lose. It's impossible\nto lose money as long as you do this on\nvery safe companies. Okay? I mean,\npersonally, I would not dare to do it on\nTesla or Palanteer or whatever, right?\nAlthough I own Palanteer as investor, I\nwouldn't dare to do in Palanteer because\nPalanteer, Tesla, these are way\novervalued. I see. And they are they I\nmean, how do you say? And some of these\ncompanies, the profits are not as\nconsistent. All right? They're still\nvery erratic. So, I wouldn't dare to do\nit on but I'll do it on you Walmart.\nI'll do it at a Costco. Yeah, sure.\nThese are slow. Not necessarily slow\npredictable. Not necessarily slow. Like\nI'll do it on Nvidia, right? Nvidia is\nnot slow, but Nvidia strong cash flow.\nYeah. All right. I'll do it on Meta.\nI'll do it on Amazon. I'll do it on\nMicrosoft. Right. So, it's not a matter\nof fast. So, it's how predictable are\nthe earnings. I see. Right. So, so\nthat's the key to it. So, like I said,\nto me, it's like a holy grail. It's like\na win-win. I can't lose. Right.\nAnd I've got I've taught this to many\nmany people now. But if you learn this,\nyou can get into trouble. In there are\ntwo ways you can get into trouble.\nNumber one, if you do this on companies\nthat are not high quality and are\novervalued. They can drop significantly\nand not come back for a long time. Then\nyou are screwed or they may never come\nback. Then you're really screwed, right?\nSo you must be very sure of the\nfundamentals. Okay, number one. Number\ntwo, you can get into trouble if you\noverlever.\nOkay, so there are people who learn this\nand they get very excited. Wow, this is\nlike free money, right? And they sell\nall these puts, but they don't actually\nhave the cash to take the shares if they\nhappen to be assigned the shares and\nthey don't have enough buying power to\nkeep rolling down the put. Okay, so it\nbecomes dangerous if we go into a\nprotracted bare market. So if you go\ninto a bare market like 0809 where the\nbare market lasts two years and you\ndon't have the buying power to keep\nrolling the put what happens then you\nget a margin call uh the broker forces\nyou to close the position and you could\nend up with huge losses okay so so like\nany trading strategy all right I always\nsay that there are a lot of great\ntrading strategies out there not just\nwhat I thought there are many right but\nif you don't manage your money properly\nuh with proper position sizing and risk\nmanagement any good trading strategy can\nblow blow up your account if you are too\naggressive. All right. But if you're not\ngreedy, if you learn to be conservative,\nyou can you can actually do very very\nwell. So would you still do those same\num selling put options in the current\nmarket right now? Yeah, I'm doing that.\nI've been I've been doing that. Right.\nSo in fact, so I you know on that day I\ncan't remember which day that was. It\nwas this big red candle. I think like\nApril 2nd. April 2nd, right? Maybe.\nMaybe. Yeah. Yeah. So on those days when\nwhen it spikes down the VIX goes crazy\nthat those are the days I sell options\nbecause when the VIX is very high and\nyou sell options you get very high\npremium and the strike price of the put\nis very far from the current market\nprice. So you get a very good deal right\nI see. Um\nnow that after this drop the last few\ndays the market has been like rebounding\nright at this point I wouldn't sell put\noptions anymore. Oh, when when markets\nkind of reversing. Yeah. So, so the rule\nis I only sell after a wave down. I\nnever sell after a wave up because wave\ndown you get high volatility, you get\ngood option premium. Now the market\nrecovers, VIX drops. Yeah. Premium. VIX\ndrops. You don't get very good premium\nanymore. Right. And after a wave up, the\nother reason I don't want to sell uh is\nbecause you you could get another\nretracement down.\nRight? Now, when I sell call options,\nuh, covered call options, not as often,\nbut I sell covered call options when, so\nI own a great company and after a very\nstrong wave up, like when it goes\nparabolic, normally there's a\nretracement or there's a consolidation,\nright? So, normally when there's a\nstrong wave up, then I sell covered call\noptions uh to collect premium. I see.\nYeah. So, that's the opposite, right?\nWave down, sell puts, wave up, sell\ncalls. Uh and both of these are with the\nintention or the purpose of collecting\nincome for yourself as a collecting\nincome. Yeah. So you don't do you ever\nuse options to hedge for your portfolio?\nI used to in the past. So in in the old\ndays whenever I I would see okay it's a\nit's a correction it's a bare market.\nI'll buy a lots of put options to hedge\nuh my investment portfolio and I'll also\nbuy call options on the VIX uh and I\nalso uh buy uh bare put spreads which is\nbasically you buy put options and then\nsell put options which is a it's a\ncheaper way than selling direct uh sorry\nit's a cheaper way than directly buying\nthe put options. All right so I buy a\nput I sell a put it's it's a it's a it's\na cheaper way to do it. So I used to do\nthat right and and I don't do that\nanymore. So for the last probably the\nlast seven eight years I no longer hitch\nmy portfolio. I no longer uh do that\nbecause I found it's not worth it. It's\nnot worth it. Right? And I'll tell you\nwhy. So I give you an example of 2020.\nOkay? So in 2020 uh when the market was\ncoming down, okay, and I saw that the\nmoving averages were sloping down, I\nthought, okay, it's it's going to go\ndown. So I bought a lot of put options\nand the market crashed and my puts made\na lot of money, right? So, a lot of\nmoney I made on puts. Um, but then the\nproblem is you don't you don't know how\nlong it's going to last, right? Okay.\nSo, my puts made a lot of money, but my\nstocks I was holding had a lot of\nunrealized losses obviously. So, when it\ndropped, I was I was buying shares and\nholding my put options. Okay. And then\nmarket suddenly reversed up very fast.\nYeah. Okay. And then uh all my all my\ngains on the puts disappeared. Oh, so\nyou did not realize the hedges? No, I\ndidn't because how would you know it's,\nyou know, how would you know it's not\ngoing to go? You won't know, right? It's\nlike boom, right? So, so all all the\nprofits of my puts disappeared. Okay.\nOkay. I made a bit. All right. But it's\nlike it was a lot and it disappeared.\nSo, in the end, I didn't make any money\non my hedging. Okay. But I made a lot of\nmoney on my stocks which I bought. Yeah.\nAnd of of course, at the same time, I\nwas also selling puts to collect\npremium. So I made on that and the same\nthing happened in 2018\nwhich was the the first trade war and\n2019 which was the uh the Fed uh taper\ntantrum and then and it happened so many\nmany times right so I realized that at\nthe end of the day every time I shorted\nthe market I hitch I hitched it you know\nand I add up all my profits it it was so\nlittle that it was not worth it that it\nmade me feel good in the short term\nbecause when the market dropped I felt\ngood. Yeah. Right. Protected. I felt\nprotect. I felt good. But in the long\nrun, I felt that I didn't really make\nmoney from it. When the market\neventually recovered, I see that it was\nnot worth the effort. And in my early\ndays as a trader, I used to do a lot of\npairs trading. So I long one, I short\none, I long one, I short one. I did\nboth. Every time I long a stock, I'll\nshort a stock. Right? And then I look at\nmy portfolio at the end of the year. I\nfound that 90% of all my profits came\nfrom my longs and very little came from\nmy shorts and it was some years where I\nlost money on my shorts and it reduced\nthe profits of my longs. I say what's\nthe point? So that's when I said so\nnowadays I hardly short okay sometimes\nlike I said it looks so tempting to\nshort\nand every time I'm going to do it I'll\nslap myself Adam remember what happened\nfirst right and then I watched an\ninterview by Stanley Ducker Miller a few\nmonths ago and Stanley Ducker Miller as\nyou know is one of the best traders in\nthe world he used to work with Soros\nhedge fund and he said and I quote he\nsaid in the last 40 years of trading if\nI add up all my short trades\nI'm afraid to look at it. I probably did\nnot make any money from it. And he said,\n\"Shorting is a lot of fun. I still do\nit, but I know I'm not gonna make money\nany money from it.\" And I said to\nmyself, if if Steady Ducker Miller can't\nmake money from a shorting in 40 years\nnow, I don't feel so bad. Right. Yeah.\nBut if you think why, it's because\nshorting whenever you short a stock or\nshort the market, the odds are against\nyou. If you look at the last 70 80 years\nin the market, right? 78% of all years\nwas bullish. 78% 22% are bearish. So if\nyou think about it, every time you short\nthe market, your odds of making money is\n22%.\nEvery time you long the market, your\nodds of making money are 78%. So think\nabout it's like think about you you\nlet's say you go to a casino, you see a\nroulette table, okay, and you see 78 uh\nblack and 22 red. Where would you bet?\nBlack or red? 78 black, 22 red. 78. You\nyou bet on the black, right? Of course.\nYeah. So, whenever you short, you're\nbetting on the red. I see. Yeah. Yeah.\nOnce in a while, you're going to get a\nred, right? But over the long run, you\nknow, the law of large numbers, you're\ngoing to lose money betting on red.\nYeah. Yeah. I guess what you're\nreferring to is markets designed to go\nup. To go up. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I\nthink a lot of traders need to hear that\nas well because because I I've shorted\nstocks here and there as well. Shorting\nis fun. It's fun to be contrarian, you\nknow, and and especially if you find a\nstock and say it's bloody overvalued. It\ndoesn't make sense and it's and I tell\nyou like for example, I remember\nLinkedIn, right? So I shorted LinkedIn\nyears ago uh when it was very very new,\nright? I remember I saw the PE ratio was\n100. I said this is freaking ridiculous.\nIt's, you know, it's a 100p. I shorted\nit. It went to 400p.\nOkay. But thank God I had a stop loss,\nright? So I I was stopped out. I entered\nI So I was stopped like three times and\nthen I said, \"Okay, that's it. I give\nup.\" Okay. All right. So were you\nshorting with um were you buying the\nputs? Were you actual shorting the I was\nshorting the I was shorting the\nunderlying but with a stop loss. Right.\nI see. And the interesting thing is that\nif you uh listen to Warren Buffett's uh\ntalks, he mentioned that in his early\ndays, he used to love shorting. Oh, he\nhe did a lot of shorting. In fact, he\nused to irritate his teachers. And this\nwas a story, you can watch it on\nYouTube, right? That because he knew a\nlot of teachers at that time were buying\nAT&T. Uh a lot of AT&T, right? And just\nto irritate his teachers, he would short\nAT&T and go to the school to show them\nhis short position.\nOh wow. Okay. And so actually Buffett\nstarted to shorting, right? And he\nrealized again over the long run that\neven if he found a company that he knew\nwas crap, he knew was overvalued and and\nyou short that doesn't mean you're going\nto make money because sometimes a crap\ncompany that's overpriced can still go\nup because in a short term is is based\non optimism and and euphoria, right? And\nyeah, so it so I don't know if you've\nheard Stanley Ducker Miller's famous\nstory. What happened in 1998? What\nhappened? Uh was it 98 99? Right. So at\na time, you know, the com boom, a lot of\nuh tech stocks that were not making\nmoney, they were they were going up like\ncrazy, overvalued. So Dra Miller says\nthis is ridiculous. They are bound to\ncollapse. So in 1999, he shorted I think\neight tech stocks.\nUh and after he shorted it, it kept\ngoing up. Which eight? I I he didn't\nmention, right? Okay. Okay. And his\nshort position was initially 100 uh if\nI'm not wrong was 100 million. Uh his\nhis his\nposition, right? Eventually, it kept\ngoing up. He couldn't take it anymore.\nOh my god. And he closed it for 600\nmillion loss.\nOkay.\n600 million loss. And the day he closed\nit was a day before the top of the\nbubble.\nOkay. And one day later, the bubbles it\ncollapsed and all those six stocks he\nshorted all went to zero. But it was too\nlate. He was stopped out at $600 million\nloss. Yeah. Right. So you can be right\non a lousy company,\nbut you can still lose everything\nbecause you know in in shorting you have\nto be right on the timing. Yeah. But\nwhen you go long, you don't need to be\naround the timing, right? Because if\nyou're a long-term investor, you know,\nyou can afford to wait. Eventually, it's\ngoing to come up. Yeah. Yeah. And it's\ngood to know that as a as a investor\nwho's long on the stock, the most you\ncould lose is, you know, everything goes\nto zero. 100, right? 100%, which is 1x.\nBut if you're right, like my Palanteer,\nlike my Nvidia, I'm up 10x. I'm up 11x.\nSo you just need to be up 11x 10x on one\ngood stock like Nvidia Palanteer to\ncover many that that didn't work out,\nright? But when you're shorting, you\nknow, your your loss is unlimited,\nright? Yeah. If you don't put a stop.\nYeah. So the the odds are just against\nyou. Yeah. Yeah. But it's just so\ntempting. It's just so tempting. Yeah.\nIt's very tempting. Um so let's go back\nto investing for a little bit. Um I\nrecall that you said you're both a value\nand a growth investor. Yeah. So\ngenerally speaking, you know, people\neither value invest like the like Warren\nBuffett or you're investing in growth\nlike the tech stocks. So these two are\ngenerally known as quite different. So\nhow do you kind of use pole principles\nfrom both approach and to build your own\ncurrent portfolio for long-term\ninvestments? Okay. So first of all this\nthis uh uh this categorization of growth\nversus value is full of nonsense. It is\ntotal nonsense. And this comes from\nBuffett himself. In fact someone asked\nBuffett once uh between value and\ngrowth. He say it's total nonsense. He\nsay it's total nonsense. Right? Because\nokay first of all what is value? Value\nsee a lot of people think that when you\nbuy a value stock low PE okay and um\nthat that's rubbish. Okay. So for\nexample, let me give you an example,\nright? When I bought Nvidia uh in\nOctober uh 2022,\num I bought it at $15 per share. This\nafter the share split price. Okay, that\ntime before the share split was 150.\nOkay. So I bought at 150 uh at the time\nand my intrinsic value was uh 220. My\nvaluation was 220. Okay. Now, so to me\nit was undervalued, but to a lot of\ntraditional value investors, they say,\n\"Oh, it's not under it's overvalued,\"\nright? Because the the the PE ratio was\nI think uh I think 40 times or 50 times,\nright? But PE is a very misleading way\nof valuing a stock because PE ratio,\nprice to earnings doesn't take into\naccount the growth of the earnings.\nOkay? And it doesn't take into account\nfree cash flow. Right? I see. So the the\nproper way to value a stock is to take\nthe present value of the future cash\nflow.\nOkay. So that's primarily how I value uh\nthese kind of stocks. All right. Um so\nto me Nvidia was undervalued. Okay. And\nis it a growth stock? Yeah. All right.\nSo I buy companies that are again have\nhuge growth potential and are\nundervalued. Right. And PE is totally\nmeaningless in that equation. Oh, right.\nSo, when people talk about value stocks,\nthey normally talk about psychical\nstocks, low PE, cyclical stocks. Those\nare stocks I never touch. I never touch\npsychical stocks. So, like oil and gas,\nI never touch oil and gas. I never touch\num commodities. I never touch uh\nshipping. I never touch real estate. I\nnever touch Yeah. Uh because these are\nvery cyclical industries that are highly\ncompetitive. Profit margins are very\nlow.\nand uh yeah I don't touch those right so\nI touch uh mainly health care uh\nconsumer discretionary\nuh technology and communication services\nand certain parts of financials because\nthey tend to have higher return on\ncapital\nuh they've got pricing power higher\nprofit margins uh and uh we call it\neconomic mode strong competitive\nadvantage so before you buy a stock or\nyou're eyeing some investments that\nyou're looking to add to portfolio. What\nare some what's your process like for\nstock selection and what are some of the\nkey criteria you look for when um\nvaluing a company? Okay, so there are\nprimarily seven things I look at and I\ndivide them into three parts. So the\nfirst part would be to ask myself this\nquestion. Is it a great business? Okay,\nnumber one, is it a great business? And\nthe second part would be okay, it's a\ngreat business, but is it a great price\nto buy? And number three is it an\noptimal entry point. So for the first uh\npart which is is it a great business I\nlook at a few things. Number one I look\nat the at least the last 5 to 10 years\nof the track record of the business. So\nI want to see the business having a very\nconsistent growth in revenue okay uh\nprofits and cash flow from operations\nfor at least 5 to 10 years. So the\nreason I want to do that is especially I\nwant to see in the last recession in the\nlast crisis did they still grow their\nrevenue did they still grow their\nprofits did they still grow their cash\nflow because if they did that means the\nbusiness is resilient the business is\npredictable and the business is\nconsistent so I only buy companies that\nhave that consistency and I would say\nthat in the whole market\nless than 5% of companies can pass that\nfirst step less than 5% less than 5%\nRight? Because most companies in a\nrecession, in a crisis, revenue drop,\nprofits drop. Right? So I want companies\nthat know revenue goes up, profit goes\nup even in a crisis. Right? So that's\nthat's the first step. Then the second\nthing I look at is I want to make sure\nthat the company has got what we call a\nsustainable competitive advantage that\nprotects it from competition. So\ncompetitors cannot easily take away\ntheir market share. Competitors cannot\neasily take away their customers. And so\nthey have got what we call pricing\npower. they are able to raise prices\nevery year without losing market share.\nOkay. So uh and to do that they must\nhave a few things. Okay. So they must\nfor example have a very strong brand\nthat are people are willing to pay more\nfor the brand. Uh they must have high\ncustomer switching cost. Uh where once\ncustomers use the product it's hard to\nswitch to another product. Like Apple's\na good example. Apple has this ecosystem\nright? Once you use your iPhone, your\nMac, your Apple Watch, you're in an\niCloud, it's it's not so easy to switch\nto another device because then it\ndoesn't sync to your iPhone, right? Or\nlike cyber security companies or like\nsoftware companies like your service\nnow, your your your Salesforce once\ncorporations use these software\nintegrate into their workflow, they\ncan't switch that easily, right? So they\nlock in customers.\nuh or a network effect for example uh in\nin in Asia we all use WhatsApp you can't\nlive without WhatsApp you know uh you\nknow you got to use Facebook in Asia uh\nin the US more of Instagram right so if\nI'm not wrong I think uh yeah close to 4\nbillion people use one of matters\nproducts right that's that's almost half\nthe world's population if you think\nabout it right so that's called the\nnetwork In fact, you know, you know, the\nmore people that use it, the more people\nwant to use it because everyone's using\nit, right? If you, if you sell stuff,\nyou got to be on Amazon, right? So, this\ncreates a mode for the business, you\nknow. So, I I look for companies with a\nmode, you know? Um so a good example of\nwhy like I didn't invest in Zoom or I\ndidn't invest in Beyond Meat or I didn't\ninvest in in PayPal\nuh even though they look cheap at one\npoint of time because I felt that these\ncompanies yeah they could grow yeah they\nlook cheap but I don't think their mode\nis very strong in other words they could\neasily be disrupted by a bigger player.\nSo once I feel that a company could be\ndisrupted by a bigger player, once I\nfeel that they don't have the pricing\npower, I I wouldn't dare to buy it. So\nto me that's a very important criteria,\nthe the mode of the company. All right.\nAnd then the third thing is they must be\nin some kind of secular\ngrowth uh industry. So for example, I\ninvest a lot in healthcare because I\nthink healthcare is a strong secular\ngrowth um semiconductor cyber security.\nSo there must be some kind of growth\ncatalyst. Uh then fourth I look at\nmanagement efficiency. How well does the\nmanagement run the business? So I look\nat ratios like return on invested\ncapital, return on equity,\nuh accounts receivables versus revenue,\nuh to make sure that they manage their\nworking capital well. Then the next\nthing I look at is debt. So if you look\nat a lot of companies that go bust\nwhether is it Lehman Brothers, Silicon\nValley Bank, what they all have in\ncommon, highly leveraged, a lot of debt,\nright? So I tend to uh avoid companies\nwith a lot of debt. So if you look at\ncertain industries, oil and gas, not all\nbut many of the oil and gas, airlines,\nautos, uh shipping, real estate, they\nall have very high debt. So I tend to\navoid those industries. I I I go for\ncompanies with a lot of cash on their\nbalance sheet, very low debt, so that in\nthe worst crisis, in the worst\nrecession, they won't go down, right? In\nfact, they'll become stronger because\nthey buy up their competition. All\nright? So once a company can pass these\nsteps, I know it's a great business.\nThen is it at a good price? Because a\ngreat business can be a bad investment\nif you overpay for it. Yeah. Then you do\na valuation. So the next step is then I\nvalue the stock and there are many\nmethods of valuation depending on the\ntype of business. So for example if it's\na bank I use what we I use the price to\nbook ratio to value it. If it's a\ninsurance company I use a discounted net\nincome. If it's um certain type of tech\ncompany I use discounted cash flow. So\nthe yeah so once it's a good business\nit's undervalued then I'm ready to buy.\nThen I look at the charts. Ah technicals\nat the very end. Then I look at\ntechnicals. Okay, is it on an uptrend?\nIs it on a downtrend? Is it\nconsolidation? And then if it's on an\nuptrend, then I wait for retracement to\na strong support level. If it's on a\ndowntrend, I wait for signs of a\nreversal, like a double bottom, like a\nstrong parabolic drop to a strong\nsupport. So you just mentioned all the\ndifferent steps you use to look at\nwhether company's a potential buy.\nWhat if the stock just never get to the\npoint the the areas of technical support\nthat you're looking at? What if you just\nnever find an entry even though it's\nbeen on your watch list for a long time?\nThen I don't buy. That's the discipline.\nThat's the discipline. So I see I have\nwatched stocks in my watch list for\nmonths and even years and not touched\nit. That is the discipline. I see.\nThat's the discipline. Yeah. Could you\nshare some of the stocks you have on\nyour watch list? Yeah. So, there's one\nthat I've been eyeing to buy, but is but\nhasn't gotten cheap enough. Uh, which is\num um\nCopart, ticker symbol CP RT, Copart. So,\nthey are they are an online uh business\nwhere they buy and sell um used auto\nparts.\nYou know, when people scrap their cars,\nthey want to sell the scrap metal. Yeah.\nYeah. I wasn't familiar with this. Okay.\nInteresting. So, it's a great business.\nIt's a damn good business, but it's\nnever cheap. It keeps going up, right?\nAnd in fact, uh, last uh, what you call\nit? Yeah. During during the the trade\nwar, it dropped and it went very near\nthe intrinsic value and before I could\nbuy it, the it it reversed back up. I\nwas like, yeah. So, it's one of those\nwhite whales I'm watching. Right. I see.\nI see. Another one is Tyler Technologies\nwhich is a software company. So as you\nknow you've heard of Salesforce and\nAdobe and Service Now. So they're all\nsoftware as a service company. So Tyler\nTechnology is a software company but\nthey specialize\num in uh providing software to the\nfederal government for court management.\nSo you know like the court the court the\njudge and all that they need software to\nrun the the the courts. Oh right. And so\nthis company very niche. So this company\nonly specializes in providing software\nto run the cord management and it's a\ngreat business, right? But I can't get\nit. It's too expensive. Won't come down.\nWon't come down. Right. Um there's no\ntariff risk in that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nYeah. Um what's another one? Yeah. It'll\ncome to my mind, but but few of these.\nThere are a few of these, right? Okay.\nYeah. Could you share some of your\nbiggest winners and your biggest losers\nin terms of your investments? Okay. So\nuh Palanteer so far has uh more than 10x\nright uh Nvidia also more than 10x those\nare the more recent ones the what did\nyou see in sorry what did what did you\nsee in Palunteer just curious uh it was\na very unique software solution uh at a\ntime um again it's something that's very\nhard to explain off the cuff but I I did\na lot of deep dive on understanding the\nbusiness the uniqueness of how they were\nable to use AI. And again, this was\nbefore Chat GPT came out, right? Okay.\nAnd by the way, I bought Palenty at 11\nbucks. It dropped to five bucks after I\nbought it. It was down 50%. Uh and then\nthis was again before Chat GPT, right?\nBut I held on to it because I I I\nbelieve in the uniqueness of its\nsoftware offering that no one offered a\nsimilar kind of software, right? So at\nthat time they only doing it more for\nthe government clients, okay, for the\nmilitary and then it was starting to go\ninto commercials and um but I only dared\nto buy it when they started becoming\nprofitable. I was watching it. I said I\nwant it to become profitable first. So\nonly when it delivered its first quarter\nof profits then I I got in. Oh, so you\nyou actually did try to time it quite\nwell. $11. No, it wasn't it wasn't a\ngood timing, right? I bought it dropped\n50% after I bought it, right? So, it\nwasn't a good timing. Same thing. It's\ngone up what? 600. No, more than that,\nright? It went up to 140. Oh, yeah. Are\nyou still in Palunteer? I'm still there.\nOh, even despite No, but I did sell\nhalf. I I I took half off uh for\nprofits. So, I'm on the other half.\nYeah. So, these are some pretty big\nwinners. Uh Palenterer, Nvidia, what are\nsome of your biggest losses or losers\nfrom your investments in the past? Uh\nokay. So in terms of percentage loss, I\nwould say my biggest one would be uh\nREIT real estate investment trust listed\nin Singapore. Uh it's called manual life\nread and basically they they invest in\nUS office properties and the problem\nwith REITs is that they are highly\nleveraged. Okay. Uh and what happened\nwas during COVID uh as you know people\nwere all work from home. So many of\nthese resets uh they couldn't lease out\ntheir office space. They couldn't they\ncouldn't earn their income right their\ncommercial property and and a lot of the\ncommercial property in the US the the\nvaluation dropped right and because\nhighly leverage so it's down 90%. Okay.\nSo biggest percentage loss 90%. I'm\nstill holding it by the way because it's\nso damn cheap. I said no point selling\nit.\nuh you know, but the good thing is that\nit's it's it's less than 1% of my\nportfolio. And so now after dropping\n90%, it's like 0.1%\nof my dividend port. No point selling\nit, right? They're still distributing\ndividends. No, they they pause their\ndividends, but they're going to start\npaying again, I think, next year or\nsomething like that. Okay. Yeah. But I I\nthink now I think it's going to come\nback, but it's not going to come back to\nwhere I bought it. No way. Right. But\nI'm sure I can get a bit more compared\nto what it's selling for because I if\nI'm not wrong, it's selling uh I haven't\nseen it for quite a while, but I think\nit's selling something like\n80% below the book value, something like\nthat. Oh, okay. Yeah. So, I have no\npoint. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.\nSo, that was the biggest percentage\nloss. Uh besides that, let me see what\nelse. Um the other big percentage loss\nwas I think Estee Lauder. Yeah, I I cut\nloss at I think I I was down like 50 or\n60%. Okay. From my entry price. Um yeah,\nthose are my two biggest ones. The rest\nwere like, you know, down 20%, down 30%.\nI I cut loss on those. Uh but the good\nthing is that they all made up less than\n1% of my portfolio. So I guess my qu\nnext next question is besides the REITs\ncompany you're still holding, how do you\ndecide when to cut your losses? It's\nlike what has to happen to the stock or\nthe company that you see that you decide\nhey it's time to get out. Yeah. So, so\nas you know trading and investing is\nvery different. For trading once we\nenter we've got a stop loss. Here's a\nstop we get out. Right. So for trading\nyou get out purely based on the price\naction. For investing I get out if I\nfeel that the business has no more hope.\nYeah. There's no more hope. Right.\nThat's it. Okay. No it's not that. Okay.\nIt's not that there's no more hope.\nRight. Okay. But I would I would sell I\nI would cut loss if a few things number\none\nif I feel that they have lost their\ncompetitive advantage. Uh that means\nthey are their economic mode has eroded.\nSo it's no it's no longer a great\nbusiness.\nUh so a good example uh so there could\nbe a few reasons. Number one could be\nmanagement really screwed it up or\nnumber two there was a huge disruption\nto their business model. So Disney is a\ngood example. Disney. Disney. Oh, okay.\nSo Disney in the old days, they they\nmade a lot of money from their linear TV\nnetworks. That's where they made a lot\nof money from and their parks obviously.\nRight now the Disney parks are still\ndoing very well. But the linear networks\nuh TV basically was disrupted by\nNetflix, by all the streaming. So that\ngone, right? So Disney this uh realized\nthat they have to go into streaming. So\nDisney Plus to make up for the loss in\nthe linear networks TV. But so far so\nfar their Disney Plus uh has not been\ndoing as well as they they projected.\nRight. That's true. Uh and it's it's\ngetting very competitive. You've got\nAmazon Prime, you've got Netflix and all\nthat. So that looks like you don't think\nthings will get better after they bring\nback um Bob Iger.\nYeah. So I mean I has been back for a\nwhile and and I you know so far I have\nnot seen any material change in that\nright. And of course Disney has gone way\ntoo woke. All right. I mean what you\nknow I mean look at their bloody Snow\nWhite. I mean yeah. So I I I think the\nbrand is totally and and to me you know\nI love Star Wars. I was the greatest\nStar Wars fan until they took over Star\nWars and they totally messed up my\nchildhood. They destroyed my my Star\nWars with their crap woke stuff on. Now\nit's personal. Yeah, now it's personal,\nright? No, no, but but seriously, no.\nNo, but yeah. No, but the the decision\nto exit was not personal. I said that's\nit. I I'm gone. Right. So, Disney is one\nof them. And um Estee Lauder,\nI think what really messed them up was\nuh they pivoted to such an extent that\n50% almost 50% of their business is from\nChina. Oh yeah. And then when the COVID\nhit, when the lockdown hit and now the\ntrade war,\nyou know, they they could get it back,\nit's going to take a very long time. I\nsee. Right. So, if I feel that if I can\nsell and take whatever's left and\nreinvest in something else that could\nmake my money back faster, that has got\nmore predictable cash flow, stronger\nmode, I'll just switch it up. Yeah.\nWhat? So, we are talking, we talked\nabout the losses, the the stuff that\nyou're looking to cut. Yeah. Yeah. That\nwas my question. how when to get out of\nthe losing position. What about taking\nprofit on winners? Uh this is in for\ntraders I guess trade. When you're\ntrading, you look at daily resistance.\nYou look at when the chart went\nparabolic, you get out. But what about\nfor investing? When do investors when\nshould they decide to take profit on\ntheir winners? Yeah. So when I first\nstarted in investing, I would take\nprofit using a lot of price action as\nwell. Okay. So the moment a stock was\nabove my intrinsic value and it was\novervalued and I saw that it went a bit\nparabolic I would sell and then I say\nokay let's wait for it to drop\nundervalued and I buy it back. So that's\nwhat I used to do in the old days right\nuh and looking back it was really very\nstupid. Yeah it was more of a trader\nmindset. uh because I made I made good\nmoney, right? Uh but when I look back, I\nrealize that if I and and many times\nwhat would happen is that you know the\nstock would go up and I thought okay\nit's overvalued it's not going to go\nhigher it's like overbought overvalued\nand I sold it and after I sold it it\nkept going up. Yeah. Okay. Right. It\nkept going up going up going up going up\ngoing up and then I said it won't drop.\nSo I tell myself I'll buy it when it\ndrops but by the time it drops it's\nstill way higher than when I sold it.\nYeah. and it's again not undervalued\nenough and then I lose out and it goes\noff without me. Then there are other\ninstances where okay the stock goes up\nit's overvalued\noverbought I sell it and once I sell it\ndrops and I feel very smart yeah I'm so\nsmart right but now the problem is when\ndo I buy it back you know so you're\nwaiting to buy it back say okay I'm\ngoing to buy it back when it gets to the\nsupport and before it hits the support\nit flies back up again\nthat yeah so when I look back in the\nlast 20 years u you know I bought ma in\nthe early days I bought Visa when It\nIPOed. Okay. I bought Microsoft. I\nbought many of these great companies in\nthe early days and I did this. I I\njumped out. I jumped in. I jumped out. I\nsee. And I realized that if I just held\non to these stocks for the last 20\nyears, today I'll probably be five to 10\ntimes richer. And so that was another\nepiphany.\nSo from there I realized that once I\nonce I I'm into a great company, I never\nsell it. Okay, I never sell it as long\nas it's still great. Okay, so even if\nit's overvalued like like Palanteer is\novervalued, right? By the way, my\nintrinsic value for Palanteer with my\nmost optimistic growth rates is $35. Oh,\nwow. Okay. It's 110. Okay. And Okay. So,\nI did sell half to to to take some off\nthe table, but the other half I'm not\nselling even though it's way overvalued.\nSo to me, as long as the business is is\nstill growing, as long as there is still\na long runway, as long as um it's not\nYeah. As long as if if I still think\nthat there's a lot of room to run, I'll\nstill hold it. So, let's talk about the\nmarket we're in today. Uh as you know,\nthere's a lot of fear in the market so\nfar this year, especially after after\nMarch or so. Um and recently, there's\nbeen some optimism. I watched in some of\nyour YouTube videos that you mentioned\nthat despite all those, you know,\nvolatility, trade wars, you know, who\nknows what's going to happen next week.\nYou still don't think we would enter\nrecession this year. Why? Why is that?\nUm, okay. First of all, I have I have no\nidea whether we will enter recession\nbecause it really depends on how long\nthese terrorists will stay. True. Okay.\nI wish we don't know unless you're\nsleeping with Trump at night and you can\nhear him talking in his sleep that\nthere's no way to know, right? So, if\nthey if they take off the tariffs, if\nthey reduce the tariffs, then fine and\ndandy, you know, but if he keeps the\ntariffs there and remains there, of\ncourse, you're going to get into\nrecession, you know, but but who who\nknows, right? But the thing to\nunderstand is that how do you know it's\na recession? When the NBER, the National\nBureau of Economic Research, declares\nit's a recession, then you know it's a\nrecession, right? Okay. Now, if you look\nhistorically,\nby the time they declare a recession,\nguess what? It's usually the end. It's\nthe o it's over. Yeah. So, there's no\nvalue in knowing when it's a recession\nbecause by the time it's confirmed, it\nis over. And if you look at again past\nrecessions, by the time they they\ndeclare the recession is here, the\nmarket would already have gone up about\n50% from the bottom because as you know\nthe market\ndoesn't reflect what's happening to the\neconomy now. The market reflects what is\nhappening in the future. The market is\nalways future pricing, right? The market\nis is a leading indicator. So the whole\nthing is that again the first thing I\nalways say is don't bother timing the\nmarket unless of course you're a trader\nright but as an investor don't bother\ntiming the market. I see but if if you\nwant to time the market don't bother\nlooking at macroeconomic data because it\nis always too late. If you want to time\nthe market look at price action. It's as\nsimple as that. Look at price action. So\nyou you're saying even for investors\nthey should look at price action. If you\nwant to time the market, which I'm\nsuggesting you don't time the market,\nbut if you do want to time the market,\nyou look at price action because price\naction leads economic data.\nAnd yeah, so so again um so if you look\nat price action, you ask yourself this\nquestion, you know, are are we are we on\na downtrend? Okay. Yeah, we are on a\ndowntrend because the 50 has crossed\nbelow the 150 moving average. Um\nalthough I don't think it's sloping down\nyet. I have to double check. I think it\nstarted sloping down but I think the 200\nday has not sloped down yet. I'm not\nsure. I I I have to check that. Right.\nWe'll double check. Yeah. But having\nsaid that, even though you see that the\nmoving averages have crossover sloping\ndown, but when price drops very rapidly,\nthat's not a good time to to sell or to\nshort because Yeah. After a sharp drop,\nyou usually have a very sharp rebound. I\nsee. Right. So if you look at again\n2020, same thing. If you by the time the\nmoving average crossed and you shorted\nor sold, you would have sold at the\nbottom. Yeah. Same same thing happened\nin 20\nuh 2018 2019 if I'm not wrong 2011 as\nwell. These were all very sharp drops.\nSo in fact in my last YouTube video I\nshowed all the previous examples when\nthe market dropped very rapidly. A lot\nof times you had a very sharp rebound\nafter that. So you don't think this\ntime's different?\nIt's always different, right? But but no\nmatter what, remember that, you know,\ncrisis never lasts forever. Corrections\nnever last forever. Eventually, it's\ngoing to get resolved. And this one is a\npurely artificially induced crisis. So\nwas 2022. 2022 was artificially induced\nby the Fed, right? Fed raised rates\naggressively. 2020 was artificially\ninduced because of the global lockdown.\nThis is artificially induced. So it is\nnot a normal economic cycle bare market.\nSo a normal economic cycle bare market\nis not artificially induced. It's\nbecause of the normal boom and bust\ncycle of the economy. That is what\nhappened in 0809 and all the previous\nrecessions. The last three were\nartificially induced.\nThat's why if you look at history, if\nyou look at the last 100 years, you\nnotice that a bare market recession on\naverage happens every six years. On\naverage, every six years, right? But we\nhad a bare market in 2020, 2022, and\npossibly one now, which not yet, right?\nIf it does happen, you that's three bare\nmarkets in 5 years, right? Okay. Yeah.\nIt has never happened in history. Okay.\nMaybe it has in the Great Depression. I\ndon't know, right? But it's artificially\ninduced which I like because when\nsomething is artificially induced once\nthey uninduce it you're back up like co\nonce they you know they they they open\nthe borders you got a vaccine once uh J\npower stop raising rates you're back up.\nI see. So that's the good thing about\nit. Oh yeah. I think a lot of people\nneed to hear this. What what do you say\nto the to the people who the investors\nwho unfortunately bought let's say\nNvidia at I forgot what what was the\npeak you know one one was it 14 was it\n180 I think sorry 140 is alltime highs\nwhat do you say to investors who bought\nNvidia at let's say 130 or palunteer at\n120 what they still believe in their\ninvestments but just unfortunately they\ntimed the top what how should they\napproach and what should they do with\ntheir investment? Nothing. Just hold on\nto it. Just buy it. Once you're in a\ngreat business, even even if you\noverpaid for it, hold on to it. You know\nwhy? Because over time, the intrinsic\nvalue would rise and catch up to the\nprice you paid.\nI think uh those are really really sound\ntips and very rational tips. Yeah. I\nmean, you got to think rationally and\nnot emotionally. And by the way,\nPalanteers is now I think it's back to\nalmost 110 already. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It\nrecovered fast. Yeah. I also hear this a\nlot even among my trader friends. A lot\nof people are calling for the market to\ngo lower, especially if the tariffs\npersist and they go they don't get eened\nup and they're waiting for the market to\ngo lower to get in to the market for\ninvestment.\nWhat what what are your suggestions for\nthese people trying to time the market\nin order to get in?\nConfucious say investor who try to pick\nbottom always end up with smelly finger.\nYou never knows where's the bottom,\nright? Yeah. Okay. You never know where\nthe bottom, right? So, I mean, yeah, you\nyou can't, right? So, if you keep having\nthat mindset that I'll get a lower\nprice, you'll never get in, right? And I\nremember there was this there's this\nchart which I showed to my students. I\nshowed it on YouTube a few times where\nif you look at at the last 10 or 20\nyears, um,\nif you just do if you just do dollar\ncost averaging or you could time the\nmarket perfectly, whatever you do, you\nwill make money. The only time you don't\nmake money is if you don't even get in,\nright? So, so the thing to remember is\nthat\nis that in the short term,\nuh, the stock market is more risky than\nholding cash. Okay? In the short term,\nthe stock market is more risky than\nholding cash because in the short term,\nyou never know where the market's going\nto go. Market can drop 20 30%. No one\nknows. So, I tell people that if you\nneed the cash for something in the next\none year or two years, don't invest in\nthe stock market, keep it in cash. All\nright? But if you don't need the money\nin the short term and it's and you want\nto build your wealth, your retirement\nfunds in the next 10 to 20 years, then\nthe longer you hold stocks, the safer it\nbecomes. The longer you hold cash, the\nmore risky it becomes because in the\nlong run, your cash is going to lose\nvalue from uh uh inflation, right? But\nstocks are going to go higher over time.\nSo it depends on your time frame, right?\nAnd I don't know whether you saw my last\nvideo where I I showed this interesting\nchart that in the last if I'm not wrong\nlast 50 or 70 years uh every time the\nVIX goes above 60 and the VIX has only\ngone above 60 I think only five times in\nthe last 70 years right so whenever the\nVIX goes above uh 60 which is panic\nright and and then drops below 35 that\nhas always marked the bottom.\nor when it spikes and it settles and\nthat's usually it drops below 35. 35 is\nthe magic number, right? And and I\nshowed it in my last YouTube video.\nOkay. And I said now is the same thing\nthat happened. VIX went above 60 and\ndropped below 35. In fact, VIX dropped\nbelow 30 uh last week. Okay. So, well\nbased on that pattern based on\nhistorical patterns. Oh, but again, no\n100% right. Depends on what Trump does\nwhen he wakes up later on. Oh, okay.\njust out of curiosity because I'm more\nof a trader and a lot of our audience\nmembers are traders as well. Yeah. Um\ntrading and investing like how much time\nare you actually watching the market as\na as an investor? How often do you watch\nthe market? Daily, weekly? You don't\nactually have to watch the market at\nall. Uh so I mean when it comes to\ninvesting\num you just have to glance at it less\nthan 5 minutes a day. Okay. And what are\nyou glancing at? So basically you're\nyou're glancing at first of all the\nstocks in your portfolio. All right. And\nwhat I'm basically looking at is I'm\njust looking is there an opportunity to\nadd more. All right. So is the price\nbelow the intrinsic value? Is the price\nat a support level? If it is, I can add\nmore up to my full allocation because\nonce I buy a full allocation, I don't\nadd more. And then I'm looking at my\nwatch list. So watch list are stocks\nthat I would like to buy, I've not\nbought yet. And again, I'm watching is\nit undervalued? Is it below the\nintrinsic value? That that's it. So less\nthan five minutes where I take a bit\nmore time maybe another\n15 minutes would be the options. I see.\nSo for that again I'm looking at uh\ndifferent watch list and I'm looking at\nwhether there's a trade there to to get\nin for an options trade. And again\nthat's for income. That's not for\ninvestments. For income. I see. Yeah. So\nyou just mentioned that um yeah you\nalways have your watches of potential\nstocks that you want to buy. So that\nmeans you hold a certain percentage of\ncash. How much percentage of your\nportfolio do you hold in cash at the\nmoment and is it higher or lower than\nnormal? Um okay so what I do is is a bit\ndifferent right? So okay so every year I\nalways allocate a certain amount of cash\nto put into my portfolio. Right. So I\nalways tell my students that the way to\nbuild wealth is spend less than you\nearn. Okay? So every year you have got\nsavings to put into your portfolio,\nright? So that's what I do every year.\nAnd so at the start of every year I have\na rough idea how much I'm going to save\nand put into the portfolio. And what\nhappens is do I end up\nusing all my cash depends on the market.\nSo because for every stock that I want\nto buy or I own, I always have about\nfour buy levels\nwhere I will average in. All right. I\nsee. So let's say last year, last year\nthe market hardly dropped very much. It\nwas more or less going up and very small\ndrops. So last year out of the amount I\nwanted to invest, I only invested 20%.\nOf what I wanted to buy? Yeah, because\nthe the stocks I wanted to buy, they\njust didn't get cheap enough, you know.\nI see. But this year we have got a\nbigger correction and more of my stocks\nare undervalued. So, so far I have uh\nbought I've used up about roughly about\n60% of my plan allocation this year. Oh,\nalready? Even though we're into was it\nApril only? Yeah, I' I've used up 60%.\nSo, I've got another 40% to deploy. I\nsee. Uh yeah. So, that's how I look at\nit. Right. And you said you plan four\nlevels for a particular stock. That\nmeans if the stock goes lower, you might\nhit all four levels, but if it doesn't,\nyou might just get correct. Yeah. Two.\nYeah. So for example, there are some\nstocks that I really love. Um and but\nbecause they only hit level one. Okay.\nSo so roughly I every time it hits a\nlevel, I buy one quarter of my intended\nallocation. Okay. So there are some\nstocks that only hit the first level and\nthen they flew up. So I could only have\none quarter allocation. So one stock,\nfor example, is MCI. Okay. You know, the\nfinancial stock that does all these\nratings, MSCI. Yeah. So I love that\ncompany, but I could only buy like a\nquarter. I see. because it didn't get\ncheap enough. Oh, and then so I've got\ncash on standby to buy the other three\nquarters if it gets there. If it doesn't\nget there, then my cash is waiting,\nright? But the cash which is waiting, I\nmake sure that that that cash is\nproducing something. So I buy into I put\ninto some uh bond ETFs for some of them\nand then some of them the cash I use to\nas as as collateral to sell puts. So I'm\nearning premium to get income on that\ncash. So the cash is at least doing\nsomething while waiting. Oh, so no\nmatter what whether it's invested or\nnot, the cash is generating at least\nsome percentage. That's right. Yeah.\nOkay. It's good to hear. Um any final\nthoughts for the traders and investors\nwatching this? Any final tips you have\nfor them? Okay. I would say that whether\nyou are investing or trading um pay\nlittle or no attention to the macro. You\nknow I think a lot of people they get\ninfluenced by macro stuff. You know what\nis the Fed doing? The yield curve the\ninterest rate the inflation the GDP. And\nto me all this is noise. All this is\nnoise. Now is macro important to the\nmarket? Yes of course it is right. macro\ncan move the markets, but the problem is\nthat it's important, but it is\nunknowable. In other words, there's no\nway to predict what the Fed will do.\nThere's no way to predict what Trump\nwill do. So, there's no point focusing\non something that you can't control.\nThat's something that you have that you\ncan't predict, right? So, it's best to\nignore all that noise because all that\nnoise will tend to interfere with your\ninvestment and trading decisions. So\nwhen it comes to trading,\nmy decision to enter and exit is purely\nbased on the price action. If I get the\nright price action, if I get the right\ncandlestick pattern, the right support,\nthe right what I enter, regardless of\nwhat Trump is saying or what the Fed is\ndoing, it's purely based on price\naction. Same reason to cut loss. So\ninvesting is the same thing. My decision\nto buy and sell is purely based on the\nfundamentals. Is it a great business? Is\nit undervalued? Is it a support level?\nIf it is, I get in. I don't care what\nthe news is saying today and tomorrow.\nThat to me is the most important thing.\nAnd so all this news is again if you\nwant to read it purely for\nentertainment. Ah never to influence\nyour decisions. Those are very some some\nuh very good tips. Thank you so much\nAdam. Thank you for your time. Right.\nThank you for having me. Okay. So, after\nthat conversation with Adam Coup today,\ndo you feel a little bit less anxious\nabout the stock market and hopefully\nless triggered to hit that sell button\non your portfolio?
