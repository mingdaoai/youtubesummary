{"transcript": "One year ago I launched an app in just 48 hours \nand sold it for $65,000 just 3 months later.\nHow is that even possible?\nI documented the whole process from \nthe moment I got the idea, to the end.\nAnd this is what we're going to talk about \ntoday. I am Nico and if you want to learn  \nthe secrets behind my biggest win so far, sit \ndown, relax, and let's go back in November 2022.\nI just learned how to code 3 months earlier \nand was desperate for my first win.\nThe previous projects I launched failed miserably and my savings \nwere getting tighter and tighter every day.\nIf I didn't figure out something in the next couple \nof months, I would have to give up and look for  \na job. So I had no choices I needed to find new \nideas to become profitable one of those idea was  \nOpen For Ads, a platform to connect advertisers \nwith content creators.\nI was working on it on a few weeks already and needed a logo before \nlaunching\nKeep that in mind because this is a very important detail.\nBack then artificial intelligence was pretty new \nand everyone talked about it.\nEspecially about generative AI, programs \nthat could generate images and text from just a description.\nI didn't have the budget for a designer, \nso I tried to make my logo using those generative AIs.\nI got decent results and ended up using one of \nthe logo for the marketplace.\nAnd this Marketplace I continued to work on it until one evening of \nDecember.\nAs I was going to bed I had an idea. An idea that would change everything for me:\nThis logo I made using AI, maybe I could make an app from that...\nI was already busy with Open For Ads \nso I didn't want to waste time on something no one wanted,\nso I gave myself a deadline of 48 hours.\nNow pay attention because this is where the real story begins.\nA 48-hour deadline would force me to \ndo the bare minimum\nto see if the idea had potential without \nwasting weeks on it.\nFor accountability, I opened Twitter and made a post saying I would launch an app in 48 hours.\nNow that I had my idea I needed to see if I could make a prototype that could take a description,\nand generate a logo from it. \nI started doing some tests \nuntil I was too tired to continue at 11:30 p.m.\nThe next morning I woke up and immediately went to work on my prototype.\nAt 11:00 a.m. I had the first version working.\nI would manually write code with a logo description, give it \nto the AI, and I would get a logo back.\nSince my technical skills were limited,\nI didn't code the AI myself\nInstead, I use pre-made models and send \nthem instructions through what we call an API,\nand they would send me a logo back.\n The prototype was done,\n but I still had to build an interface \nto let users generate the logo from the website directly. \nBut considering I had more than 24 hours left,\nI thought it would be no big deal...\nOr at least , that's what I thought.\nBecause at 10:40, p.m. after \nworking non-stop for the whole day \n \neven during an earthquake, I was still not done and\nI had to go to bed without the interface ready\nAnd worst in the middle of the night, I got woken up \nby drunk people screaming outside\nI woke up the next day at 8:20 a.m., \ncompletely exhausted\nwith less than 12 hours to finish the app. \nCoding was still pretty new for me back then,\nand at 1 PM, I just realized that I didn't have\nthe skills to finish the interface in time.\nIn this situation, it would have been reasonable to delay \nthe launch. But I made a post on Twitter promising  \nthat I would launch in 48 hours so I had no choice. \nBut I had an idea.\nA couple of weeks earlier, a guy names Pieter Levels\nlaunched an app to make AI-generated \navatars. But instead of coding a user interface he  \nused Typeform, an app to create and host forms online.\nBut the key part is they also have an option to collect payments.\nSo instead of coding a full user interface \nfrom scratch, I could just use  \nTypeform to collect the user information and \ntell them they would receive the logo within  \n24 hours. But behind the scenes, I would manually \ngenerate a logo using the code and send an email  \nmyself to customers. But it wasn't over.\n Even  if I didn't need it to make an interface anymore\nI was still missing the most important part.  \nThis part is often what will make or break your startup\nI'm talking about your Landing Page's copy.\nIf your website was a physical store,\nthe copy would be the salesman.\nSimply said it is the reason why people\nbuy from you or not.  \nYou could have the best product in the world, if you \ncannot sell it it is worth nothing.\nThe first step of a landing page is the hero section. It is \nwhat people will see right when they open the website\nI started with a headline. I needed a \nway to immediately show people what the app was about,\nand a great way to do that is to use comparisons. \nFor example instead of saying  \n\"High quality and cheap logos\", I wrote: \n\"Designer-quality logos for less than a coffee\".\nAnother rule to make good landing pages is show don't tell.\nI made a small animation to explain\nhow the app was working.\nThen I listed some of the main features, added a \"How it works\" section, a gallery with examples\nand a \"FAQ\" section. \nFor the pricing, I used a technique called decoy. You take  \nyour base price and you add one or two extra options.\nA cheaper one that isn't really a good deal\nand a more expensive one with more features, \nbut is also way more expensive.\nJust by doing that, our first option looks like an amazing deal \ncompared to the other ones.\nAt 6 p.m. I was finally done with a landing page and it was now time to find a name for my new startup.\nFor that I kept things simple it's an app to make logos using AI so I called it...\nMakeLogoAI\nyeah, not the most creative name.\nbut it's easy to read, it clearly convey \nwhat the app does, and most importantly it was available\nat 8:00 p.m. the app was still not \nfully ready and I only had 40 minutes left \nI still had to make a few tweaks like adding analytics \nso I could see where users were coming from.\nBut luckily at 8:48 PM, exactly 48 hours after my initial \ntweet,\nthe app was launched and I made a post on Twitter.\nafter 48 Hours of intense work the app was \nfinally launched.\nAt this time I was new on Twitter and I had under 500 followers.\n500 followers on Twitter isn't much. in fact, it is pretty much nothing.\nHowever, there is one very important detail. \nYou remember this post I made 48 hours ago?  \nWell, turns out people like challenges. And they like challenges, especially when it's against the odds.\nand what is more against the odds than launching \na startup in 48 hours? Because of that the launch  \npause became viral enough to generate a couple of \nsales and validate the idea. In just a few hours it  \ngenerated $75 and after 48 Hours it made $130 \nof sales.\nThis isn't much but it was enough to validate the idea and show me it had potential.\nBut what does \"validated\" means?\nIt doesn't mean your app will make millions and it doesn't mean your app  will get thousands of users overnight.\nIt just means that there are a few people on Earth that are \nwilling to pay for what you have does.\nFor me back then, with less than 500 followers $130 was more \nthan enough.\nBut for example Now with an audience of almost 30,000 followers on Twitter,\n$130 of sales will be a complete failure.\nSo it really depends on the situation\nIf you're just starting \nfrom zero, five customers is a very good start. But back to our story now.\nSince the app generated sales during the first 48 hours,\n I knew there would probably be more demand.\nbut keep in mind that at this point everything is manual. \nI would receive a notification\n telling me someone purchased then \nI would generate the logo manually using the code  \nand I would send them an email with the logo attached. \nThat was definitely not sustainable if\nI had more than a couple customers per day. \nBut for now, that was not an issue. \nAfter all this hard work  it was time to rest a bit.\nOr was it...? \nJust as I was ready to relax,\nI saw someone on Twitter working  \non a very similar app. And that was a big problem.\nWhy? Because when you are the first one to launch  \nsomething with a new tech people are curious \nabout it they want to see the possibilities  \nand they give you attention lots of attention but \nhere is the problem: It only works once.\nThink about it, when the first iPhone was released, \neveryone was crazy about it.\nEvery media talked about the iPhone. \nPeople were fighting to get it.\nBut now? No one cares.\niPhone are boring we already know the  \npossibilities there is no hype, there there is no novelty effect. That meant only one thing for me  \nI had to be the first. And for that, I had a plan.\nThis plan involved aiming to get an award on the biggest website for Tech products.\nFor those of you who don't know, Product Hunt is a website  \nwhere new tech products are launched every day and get votes. \nAt the end of the day, the three products\nwith the most votes become \"product of the day\"\nand are featured in the newsletter and the homepage\nBut what's the point? \nAccording to similar web, Product Hunt get more than 4 million  \nvisitors per month and among those four Millions \nthere are a lots of journalists looking to write  \narticles about the lastest tech product. So when you are \"Product of the day\" you don't just get an  \naward you get an insane amount of exposure. \nThis is a massive opportunity for any new tech product.\nFor this reason, I decided to launch on Product Hunt \nonly 2 days after my initial launch.\nThat was the only way I could be sure my competitor would \nnot do it first and get all the attention. \nAt this point I was still doing everything manually \nand it would take me hours to generate the  \nlogos if I had more customers. Plus, most people prefer not to wait 24 hours.  They want logos and  \nthey want logos now. That means only one thing:\nI had to finish the user interface and prepare  \neverything for the launch in less than 48 hours \nso I made a post on Twitter and went back to work  \n48 hours later I had my user interface ready \nand the app was fully automated people could  \npay and generate logo without me I was finally \nready to prepare for the big launch. But let's  \nbe real Product Hunt is incredibly competitive \neven getting \"Product of the day\" #3  is  \nvery very hard. But it was fine my main goal was \nto launch before competitors and even if I hoped  \nfor the best, I did not expect much. \nI spent the rest of the day making the Product Hunt  \npage and at 3 PM in Bali time, it went live.\nThen, this happened...\nIt completely obliterated the other products \nlaunching that day and even better it generated  \nover $1,000 of sales during the night. I \nnever imagined that it was going to blow  \nup that much. And it wasn't over after the \nlaunch some media talked about the app and  \nit generated even more sales my instinct was \nright the novelty effect gave me a massive advantage.\nThe hardest was done but I still \nhad work to do. During the weeks following the  \nlunch the app kept generating revenues every day,\nranging from $100 up to $500. \nBut the work was not over. I had to improve the app and add \nnew features to make customers happy.\nUntil now, the app only generated the icon part of logos not \nthe full version with a brand name. So I spent the  \nnext couple of weeks working on improving the \napp and releasing feature people asked me. \nBut the average person expected a better quality and \nmore customization options. Even if the majority  \nof users were happy with the result I started to \nreceive messages from unhappy customers asking  \nrefund every few day and that impacted my mood a lot. \nI also started to run out of ideas to promote  \nthe app and this was without counting that I \nstarted to get a bit burned out after working non-stop  \nsince August 2022. That was 6 months \nof working non-stop without taking a proper break or weekend. \nThe straw that broke the camel's back \nwas in February 4th where I got a massive  \nfot poisoning it lasted for a whole week and \neventually sent me to the hospital because\nI didn't take it seriously and just wanted to work.\nThe combination of unhappy customers not knowing  \nhow to grow the app further and my health made \nme think that I needed some change.\nIn mid-February I decided to list MakeLogoAI on \nAcquire.com for $49,000.\nAcquire.com is a Marketplace to buy and sell startups easily. You just have to list it and they put you in contact with  \npotential buyers, prepare the legal documents for you, and everything else you need.\nA common practice when selling startups is to take\nthe last 12 months of sales\nand multiply this number \nby 2 to 5 depending on the project.\nso I just multiplied my revenues by 2.\nI didn't put more than that\nbecause I wanted it to be a good deal for the \nbuyer to finish the process fast. I prepared a  \nfull document explaining how to improve the app \nand fix the issue then published the listing.\nIt was approved the next day and I immediately received \nmessages from potential buyers. I spent some time  \nanswering the questions by email then scheduled \nall the call with potential buyers during one  \nday February 24 2022. I was stressed but the \ncalls went well and scheduling them all on the same  day\ncreated some kind of bidding war between buyers. The first buyer offered me $50,000  \ncash another one offered me $60,000 but paid over \none year and finally the last one did not want  \nit to waste time and offered me $65,000 cash to \nthe condition that we would finish everything  \nby the end of the week. And this was absolutely\nsurrealistic to me. I would get $65,000 cash\nplus $25,000 of profit I made with the app which is \na total of $85,000. Honestly that was a lot  \nfor me so I took the rest of the day off and I \nwent to walk on the beach to think a little bit.\nI made sure the buyer was aware of the problem \nof the app but he had a team of engineers that  \ncould both both improve the quality of the logo and \ntheir interface. It was the perfect match for me  \nwe concluded the sale shortly after and on March \n11 it was official I sold my startup for $65,000", "language": "en-US", "title": "I SOLD my AI startup for $65,000 (I made it in 48h)"}
