{"transcript": "I had heard stories of people making\nmillions of dollars a year getting\ncreators to create short form content on\nTik Tok and Instagram, but I didn't know\nhow they were doing it. I had Cody\nSchneider come and teach us how to\nactually make this happen. He shared all\nthe tools you need to use, how to manage\nit, why creators with zero followers are\nbetter than creators with 100,000\nfollowers. If you stick to the end of\nthis episode, you will understand how to\nmake the most of Tik Tok, Instagram\nreels, short form, everything in\nbetween. Specifically, valuable for\npeople who want to build a mobile app,\ne-commerce, you name it. Enjoy the\nepisode and like for the algorithm and\ncomment for my soul.\n[Music]\nCody, by the end of this episode, what\nare people going to take out of it?\nTotally. You're going to walk away from\nthis understanding how for you page\ncontent has changed the relationships\nbetween brands and influencers or\ncreators. what's the difference between\nan influencer and a creator and then how\nto basically execute on influencer or\nsorry on creator marketing uh and to\nactually like measure the ROI and like\nwhy it makes sense to do this in\ncomparison to just going and doing like\npaid ads on a channel. So,\nand today we're going to talk about\nshort form specifically, right? Because\nwe've talked about long form on the pod\ntogether, but today we're going to talk\nabout short form, right? Today we're\ngoing to talk about short form, how it\nfits into your marketing strategy and\nhow this can be used for, you know, like\nthe apps that you're building with that\nyou're vibe coding, um, and what types\nof companies that this works well for,\num, and what type of what types of\ncompanies this doesn't work well for.\nSo,\ncool. Uh, let's get into it. I will say\nI am somewhat skeptical of short form\nversus long form. I'm just I mean, as\nyou know, I love\nYou're biased though, baby. You're\nbiased.\nI know. So, I hope that by the end of\nthis I'm going to be Mr. Short Form. So,\nlet's see.\nI think it can work. Again, it there's\ncertain types of companies that this is\nbest for. Um, this is best for like\nsocial app or sorry, u like BTOC\napplications, right? So, like mobile\napps. Um, this is best for um like\nproducts that have one killer feature\nthat they're doing. Um, so think about\nlike something like an incogn, right?\nwhere it's like data brokers are selling\nyour emails, right? Like something like\nthat. Um, this company like, you know,\nbasically blocks the sale of your their\ndata bro like that that type of thing\nwhere it's like simple. Um, it's it's\nit's way better. What this isn't good\nfor is something where there's like a\nlearning curve and that needs to have\nlike more of a, you know, a long form u\nuh like kind of upskill on how to use\nthe product if that makes sense. So\nyeah, but cool. To start, let's just\ntalk about like creators versus\ninfluencer marketing. I talked to so\nmany boomers and Gen X that are like\nfollowers, man. Like they don't have\nanything. Why are we working with them?\nAnd it kills me because that's not how\nthe internet works anymore whatsoever.\nSo social has evolved. Tik Tok changed\neverything. Um it basically took it from\na who you follow and your social graph\nis how you get served content to what\nyou're interested in. It's going to\nunderstand you better than yourself and\nit's basically just going to give you\nthis like, you know, unlimited drip feed\nof brain rot that's going to keep you on\nplatform as much as possible. So why do\nthey do this? And that is the answer is\nbecause it keeps you on platform longer\nthan when it's just social graph\ncontent. So people can say, \"Yeah, I\nmissed the old Instagram where it's like\nI just would see my friends post.\" News\nflash, they are there to make money.\nThey need to make the only way they make\nmoney is by selling your attention. And\nto keep your attention the best right\nnow is by basically showing you content\nfrom this for you page algorithm that is\nmost likely uh to keep you present, most\nlikely to keep you on on this. And all\nof them are doing this now, right? Like\nif you look at Twitter, if you look at\nInstagram reels, if you look um at\nLinkedIn, if you look at YouTube, um\nthey're all for you page content where\nthere's this discovery mechanism that's\nin it. So as a as a um as like a brand\nthat's thinking about this as a\nmarketing channel, you need to focus on\nreally like the creators are the value\nthat exists. like somebody that\nunderstands your niche and how to get\nlike views and traction within the\ncategory that you're in is going is the\nmost valuable part of this. I don't\nreally care if an influencer like and\nand we can just break down the numbers,\nright, Greg? So like but say I go and\nlike this influencer has uh we'll say a\n100,000 followers, right? And here's\nthis creator and I'm not even they don't\neven have they have zero followers when\nI start working with them, right? Um,\nbut I'm going to break down like why\nthis works. So, the influencer, say I go\nand I pay them, you know, they're\nthey're going to charge me whatever.\nWe'll say two grand for a post, right?\nOr something ridiculous. And the idea\ntraditionally is that like, oh, I would\nbe tapping into the trust of their\naudience. People like, and all of our\ndata supports this, people do not make\npurchasing decisions largely off of like\ninfluencers. They make them off of\ncreators that are consistently talking\nabout these things. Influencers only\nwork if you're at like a ma massive\nscale, like you're like a Kim Kardashian\nor something like that, but there's a\nreason that they're going and making\ntheir own products to sell to their\ntheir audiences that they've cultivated\nbecause they know how valuable the\naudience is, right? Like for those brand\ndeals. Um, so the breakdown here, say I\npaid them 2,000. In contrast, I'm and\nwe'll say that the post that's for like\none post and you know it's a it's a one\nout of 10 that a post has some virality,\nright? Like we we know you play this\ngame like with YouTube like or and all\nthe other content that you do out of all\nyou know out of all the content that I\npublish, one of them will will\noutperform. It'll be the outlier to the\nrest of them. And so if I'm only getting\none at bat\nand I know that it's one out of 10,\nright? there's only a 10% chance that\nthat thing actually like is an outlier\nfrom a content standpoint. And so maybe\nthis thing gets, you know, and this is\nnot like unrealistic, only 30,000 views,\nright? In contrast, if I go work with a\ncreator and the payment for that\ncreator, right? So we're going to just\nlike break this down. So the followers\nuh is 10,000, cost is 2,000, and post\nviews uh is 30,000. In contrast, if I\nwork with a creator and I pay them $900\na month to do a post per day,\nSam Alman, the co-founder of OpenAI,\njust said that it is the era of the idea\nguy, and he is not wrong. I think that\nright now is an incredible time to be\nbuilding a startup. And if you listen to\nthis podcast, chances are you think so,\ntoo. Now, I think that you can look at\ntrends uh to basically figure out uh\nwhat are the startup ideas you should be\nbuilding. So, that's exactly why I built\nideabrowser.com. Every single day,\nyou're going to get a free startup idea\nin your inbox and it's all backed by\nhighquality data trends. How we do it,\npeople always ask. We use AI agents to\ngo and search what are people looking\nfor and what are they screaming for in\nterms of products that you should be\nbuilding and then we hand it on a you\nknow silver platter for you to go check\nout. Um, we do have a few paid plans\nthat, you know, take it to the next\nlevel. Uh, give you more ideas, give you\nmore AI agents and more almost like a\nchat GBT for ideas with it. But you can\nstart for free ideabrowser.com. And if\nyou're listening to this, I highly\nrecommend it\non Tik Tok, Instagram, YouTube shorts.\nSo across all the channels\nand I know that 10% of those 30 posts,\nright? So 30 times 0.1 is are going to\njust outperform the rest of them. It's a\ngreater likelihood that I get a better\nreturn on that $900 than I get on this\n2,000. And the only reason that this\nworks is because it's for you page\ncontent, right? It's because the\nalgorithm is just going to show content\nthat's most likely to keep the person on\nthe platform. They don't care where it's\ncoming from. That's how a creator with\nzero followers, right, can actually like\ndo this. And as a brand, this is like\nwhat people do. This is what you should\nbe doing is you go find creators within\nyour niche that are already posting\ncontent in your category. You reach out\nto them and you're like, \"Hey, I'll pay\nyou 900 a month to post a video per day\nacross all the channels. They're going\nto create a brand new account, right? So\nimagine it's like example company uh\nlike Alley, right? and like whoever the\ncreator's like name is and\nthey're what you're going to see is\nthey're going to figure out a format\nthat outperforms the rest and then they\ndouble down on that format over and over\nand over again basically remixing it and\nfrom this what ends up happening is I'll\ngo like one of these videos will pop and\nsay one of those videos goes and it gets\nme a 100,000 views right so\nwhen we break down the CPM which is the\ncost per thousand views. This is this\nold march marketing metric, right? Um\nthe cost per thousand views ends up\nbeing way cheaper for the creator\nmarketing than it does for the\ninfluencerled marketing even though the\ninfluencer has more followers. And so\nthis is the arbitrage that exists\nbetween creators and the influencers.\nThe other thing we have to think about\nhere though is if I just took that same\nmoney, that $900 and I took that to\nFacebook and I paid that $900, right?\nThe average CPM on Facebook is about $6\ndepending on which like category you're\nin. So of that 900, right, I would only\nget 150,000 impressions.\nOkay? So, as long as the creator has a\ncouple of these that hit, and we'll say\nmaybe in aggregate they do 500,000\nimpressions, right? So, I'm paying $900\nfor 500,000 impressions. So, the cost\nper,000 impressions is going to be uh a\n$180.\nSo, we'll say $2, right? So, I'm getting\na CPM by working with these creators.\nI'm getting a CPM that's cheaper than\nwhat I could pay on Facebook. And this\nis the real like arbitrage that's here.\nThis is why people are are like obsessed\nover this, are doing this, etc. Like,\nyou know, you go down the list. And the\nthe the other piece of this is you don't\nwork with just one creator. You work\nwith like five to 10 of them. And\nthere's this compound learning effect\nthat happens. So, if I have a video\ngoing a video a day going out from five,\nyou know, 10 different creators, that\nmeans that I have uh 10 different videos\nthat are dropping. And of those 10\nvideos, one is going to hit, one is\ngoing to be an outlier. Like, it's like\njust, you know, based on the math. I\ntake that learning and I share that with\nall my other creators. And then it\ncreates this growth flywheel where\nthere's like more surface area for\nlearning on the like of of of um like\nwhat content types are most likely going\nto create uh uh basically reach for the\nfor the product. And so that's kind of\nthe like theory behind it. Now we'll get\ninto the actual like pro like\napplication. But before we do that\nquestions I can try to answer.\nI mean I would love to see some examples\nof like have you seen this work?\nYes.\nLike is it just theory or or does it\ndoes it work? 100% it works. And it's\njust like the again like we we've talked\nabout this in other videos like you're\nlooking for marketing arbitrage. Like if\nI can pay say again like we'll do Tik\nTok, right? Like if the Tik Tok CPM is\n$8 to get in front of people, but I can\nget in front of them for $2, right, by\ndoing creator marketing. Like that's a\nbetter allocation of the budget, the\nlimited resources that I have, right?\nThat's the whole game that we're playing\nhere. Um, now the the challenge is\nfinding the creators that are like most\nlikely to do this, but or sorry, most\nlikely to actually create people to go\nand sign up for the product, but the we\ncan like show an example of like one.\nUm, so my friend runs this company. It's\ncalled like Focus Tree, and this is like\nliterally their exact strategy is they\nfind these creators\nand that are in like uh I don't know\nwhat you would call it like self uh like\nthey basically use this. It's like an\napp where it's like you turn it on when\nyou're studying and it like it's like a\nit's like a don't use your phone type of\napp, right? Like a like a productivity\napp. Um, so this is their exact\nstrategy. I know Lauren has like scaled\nfrom like zero to it's like two million\nusers or something like that now. I I I\ndon't know since the last time I talked\nto him like where where it's at, but\nthis is how this can be used. And again,\nit's all you're looking for is these\noutlier videos and then sharing that\nwith your entire team, right? So this is\njust one of the like thousands of Tik\nTok or sorry the hundred of hundreds of\nTik Tok uh usernames that are basically\nuh in this creator like you know\necosystem that he's using. So why does\nthis work? The product is included\nwithin the content. You're getting it at\na cheaper cost than if you were paying\nuh Tik Tok directly for those ads. And\nthen uh you also have this learning\nmechanism where it's basically these\ncreators are using the uh the learnings\nfrom everybody else to go and create\nmore content. The best performers, you\ntake those, you turn those into paid ads\nas well. It basically turns into like a\nUGC content form for your company. Um so\nyou find the winners, pull those out,\nput ad spend behind them. They're going\nto if they work organically, they're\nalso going to work uh in a paid setting.\nSo\nalso organic always works better than\npaid. Just like think about it, right?\nYou know, people don't love to buy\nthings from a paid ad. They'd much\nprefer to buy it from, you know, content\nthat feels organic. And that's what this\nfeels like. I think like an old analogy\nto this strategy is like uh you know\nbuying meta ads is almost like you're\nbuying a billboard in a busy town square\nand you're hoping that people are going\nto look up at the billboard and then\nthey're going to convert versus what\nthis is is like you're almost giving out\nflyers, value ad flyers around here's\nlike the 10, you know, the 10 the the 10\nhighest rated restaurants in this area\nand like one of them is your restaurant\nand it's like, \"Oh, thanks for this like\nvalue ad information, friend.\"\nTotally. Totally. And this is actually\nthe best performing ads, right? Is when\nit feels like it's native content on the\nplatform. And so like we more and more\nlike I'm trying to make the ads look\nlike they they were edited on an iPhone,\nright? They were like recorded on an\niPhone, dropped into Cap Cut, and then\nlike edited in Cap Cut on an iPhone or\nedited literally in the Instagram app on\nthe iPhone. Right. So,\nrecorded on an iPhone 5S.\nExactly. Exactly.\nAnd I think that that's like\nuncomfortable to a lot of brands, right,\nto use media like that because they're\nlike, \"Oh, we want to do this like super\nsexy like, you know, be like shooting it\nwith like a red camera.\" And it's like,\n\"We don't need to do that, right? Like\nliterally, we can hire some like\n20-year-old creator that's just trying\nto like pay for school. And this is how\nthese creators function, right? It's\nlike they'll have brand deals with\nmultiple companies. So, say they're\nworking with five different companies.\nThey're making five grand a month while\nthey're going to college. They have to\npost five videos a day. That's nothing\nfor them. That's the whole angle here.\nThis is like why they do this. So,\nso how do we Okay, I'm I first of all,\nI've never thought of thought of this\nsort of delineation between creators and\ninfluencers. I haven't really thought\nmuch about the strategy. I'm bought in.\nI want to do it. How do I do it?\nYeah, totally. So, the process here is\nfind first off, you need to find people\nthat are talking about the content that\nyour category is in. So, say you're\ntrying to like sell something to people\nthat are like vibe coding or like we'll\ndo like lovable as an example. Um, so\nlike here's a great example of lovable\ndoing a strategy like this, right?\nWow.\nLike coding_dev.app\nlike they're 100% they at least tested\nthis. Um, and so uh but this this is\nprobably a different strategy where it's\nlike an in-house team is doing this or\nthey're like paying a clipper or\nwhatever, right?\nWe can get into the Clipper verse\ncreator thing. I don't think Clippers is\nreal. I think all the data is absolutely\n[ __ ] fake, but we'll uh we can go\ndown that rabbit hole if you want. Um\nthe uh so the angle here though is\nbasically you're trying to find people\nthat are talking about this like your\ncategory. And the only way to do this\nreally effectively is just like going to\nTik Tok and like scrolling and watching\nvideos that are in like the brain raw\nvideos that are in your category. If you\nwatch enough of them, you're going to\nget siloed into this like space and then\nyou're going to start seeing these\nrecurring faces, these recurring\ncreators on the platform. You go and\nreach out to them via DM or sometimes\nthey have like emails in their bios and\nask them, you know, hey, I want to work\nwith you. Uh, you know, 30 videos per I\nwant to basically hire you on a cost per\nvideo basis. Uh, you know, video per day\nfor 900. And then that's that's the\nreach out process. Same same play here\nis like I'm basically like going to work\nwith a bunch of them. I'm going to find\nthe best performers and then those best\nperformers I keep them on a retainer. I\nget rid of the worst and then I restart\nmy cycle, right? And so I'm just trying\nto add like add up as many of these\ncreators as I can um to find the the the\nthe best people. Um and there's only so\nmany per category. So like you it really\ndepends on like how sophisticated the\nspace is. Like again, if you're talking\nabout like some type of vibe coding app\nor like say you build an application\nthat's for like um people that do real\nestate investing. So you like there's\ngoing to be like probably way more\npeople talking about real estate that\nyou can use um than you know these\nsmaller categories. It just depends. But\nthat's the whole strategy here is like\nyou're trying to find the best people\nthat are already making content in this\nplace. Then they go and they make an an\nentirely new account. So a fresh account\nand then they're starting from zero.\nThey're starting from zero followers.\nBut they can go and because it's again\nthis for you page content they can get\nthis reach like they never could\npreviously. Um, and when this is like\nexecuted well, right, you again like get\nthis at a cheaper cost than what you're\nseeing in these other places. So, that's\nhow you find the creators. You reach out\nto them. Um, it's a super manual\nprocess. We talked about this on another\nepisode. There's this application called\nStormy AI which helps with that actual\nlike uh identification of these people.\nSo, Stormy works is you can basically\nlike go and search for creators for by\neach uh each category. Um, so like Tik\nTok or Instagram or like YouTube, right?\nUm, and put in the uh the category that\nyou're in. Uh, it's going to find those\npeople and then you can DM uh directly\nthrough this. Why Stormmy is really\ngreat is it handles the the whole\nreachout process as well and negotiation\non the pricing, which is amazing because\nit's like that's the massive time suck.\nUm, but that's kind of the the strategy\nhere. Um, is basically to like go and\nfind the the these people, these\nindividuals. Um, with all this said,\nlike here's the negatives of this,\nright? The\nmanagement of the creators is a pain. So\nthat's like one piece. So how people\ntypically combat that is they go and\nthey hire like whoever their best\nperformer is, they make them a manager\nof all the other creators. So they're\nstill having to do their videos per day,\nbut they they pay them more basically to\nmanage the entire team. And they're\nmaking sure the entire team is actually\ndelivering on what they're saying. And\nthen the other piece is when they see a\nwinner, an outlier from the entire team,\nthey share that with the rest of the\nteam. So how do you actually like track\nthat? What are the tools to do this?\nStormy is for the reach out to actually\ntrack the success of this campaign. You\ncan use something like shortize which is\nbasically your creators submit their\nvideos and then it tracks the amount of\nviews, engagements, etc. from what\nyou're doing. You can also use viral\napp. It's basic it's shortmize and viral\napp are similar in kind of what they're\nwhat they how they function but it's\nbasically tracking the success of your\nyour campaigns that you're running right\num and then the other uh tools that are\nuh really valuable for this is is\nbasically like we're trying to find\noutliers right we're trying to find the\num the videos that are performing better\nin a category than like other ones and\nto do that uh there's tools out there\nthat you can basically use to go and\nfind these like outlier winners. One of\nthem is called uh uh Virulo. I don't\nknow how to pronounce it, but it\nbasically aggregates it scrapes and\naggregates all of these um uh Tik Toks\nuh and uh and YouTube shorts and\nInstagram reels and it makes them\nsearchable so you can find outliers\nwithin the category that you're in. And\nthen you're like, \"Oh, this worked\npreviously. Let's hand this off to my\ncreator team and let them remix that for\nour brand.\" And then another one that\ndoes this as well is called Sand Castles\nAI. Um, and it also uh is basically like\nthis research tool that helps you find\nthose types of viral shorts. So that's\nkind of the stack that you're using is\nlike manual reachout um or some type of\nlike AI agent like Stormy. Uh you get\nthem into like it's literally just like\nin a Discord server is how a lot of\npeople or like a WhatsApp group is how a\nlot of people manage these. Um and then\nyou're doing the tracking with some with\na tool uh again like viral app or\nviral.app or shorttomize. Um and then uh\nhelping them find those uh those like\nviral uh outliers by using one of these\nlike discovery tools. That's the whole\nplaybook here. Um it's really simple.\nIt's just like the one of these things\nthat gets like hard to execute\nlogistically. And that's like why a lot\nof people stay away from this and why\nlike a lot of brands have trouble doing\nthis because hiring somebody that\nunderstands what I just described is\nlike impossible. Like it's like they're\nalso like probably a 22-year-old that's\njust coming out of school that's hella\nflaky and like you know just they're\nthey're going to be rogue. Like they're\ngoing to be kind of difficult to work\nwith. And so it's it's figuring out like\nlike how do I I work with that person\nand make this make sense. So yeah,\nquestions I can try to answer about\nthat.\nThere's going to be some pain. There's\ngoing to be some pain managing some of\nthese creators. But if you can suffer\nthrough the pain, there will be some\ngain likely. Uh if you could find the\nright creators, find the right formats,\nmanage them appropriately, don't lose\nthem, uh track, you know, track all this\nstuff and then also keep up to date with\nlike what new formats are coming out. Um\nI think that you mentioned in the\nbeginning which is this is particularly\nvaluable for people in like consumer\nmobile mobile apps. I mean the example\nyou used was a mobile I think a mobile\napp. Um this whole generation of like\nCalai the Twitter app you know the whole\nlike app mafia gang. Um you know these\npeople making kids you know young people\nmaking millions of dollars a year\nthrough mobile apps. I think a big\nreason why is they understand this\nstrategy and they understand how to\nmanage these people.\nTotally.\nSo I'd be curious your thoughts on that\nspecifically.\nI think the thing that I, you know, I\nthink about with this is like it has to\nbe an impulse purchase decision that can\nhappen on a mobile device, right? So\nlike this works for as well for like\ne-commerce products where it's like at a\nprice point that's like say $29 or\nsomething like that, right? I mean that\nsame strategy can be used for Tik Tok\nshop. You go find Tik Tok shop creators,\nyou pay them on a per video basis and\nthen also give them an affiliate\ncommission of everything that they\ndrive. But the reason this works is like\nif I can on my phone go and search this\nthing and start using it like that that\nand there's no like transition to like a\nweb application or anything like that,\nright? Um, and there's no learning\ncurve. Like it drops me into it and I'm\nlike instantly I I I understand like the\nvalue of this like that there's that\nkiller feature instantly on my phone\nwhich again could be a physical product\nthat's being sent. Um, that is where\nthis like fits into the marketing stack.\nSo that's one piece. The other side\nthough is that like if say you are a web\napplication or like you're an API\nprovider which is like a friend's\ncompany that's doing this that's like\nthis is working for which is hilarious.\nIt builds top offunnel branded search\nwhich creates this like discovery\nflywheel and also like you you're\nbasically just creating more surface\narea. I talk about like digital gravity,\nright? Which is like this like how do I\ncreate as much surface area for my brand\nwithin my category and like layer on all\nof these strategies. This is a thing\nthat can be layered on for like a\ntraditional like even like B2B or B to\nSMB type company because if you think\nabout Tik Tok or like Instagram like\nthey're touching so many people like\ntheir their daily activives in the US is\ninsane, right? There's 100% chance\nthey're probably touching a certain\npercentage of your target customers. So\nif you can create content that's going\nto be like naturally displayed in front\nof those people from across these count\nthese accounts like you're going to own\nmore and more mental real estate within\nthat category right which is naturally\ngoing to increase branded search and we\nsee this right a video goes viral on Tik\nTok or something like that and branded\nsearch volume sees a spike like and how\nwe're tracking that branded search\nvolume is in Google search console you\ncan say hey can the query contains\nwhatever my brand name is right so when\nyou run these campaigns what you'll see\nis that you will see like an increase in\nbranded search. They see this in\nparticular in ecom. It's actually wild.\nThey like they go you do this you go\nviral on Tik Tok, right? And then the\nbranded search on Amazon increases\nlike absolutely wild, right? Like\nthere's like a lift in the in in\nbasically the branded search that's like\ndirectly like on a platform that's not\neven related. And so that that is like\nthis other piece of this. It's it's hard\nto quantify like the value and the ROI\nthere. But if you're just like, yo, I'm\njust trying to have an entire industry\nknow that I exist. This is how this\nmarketing strategy can be layered with\nsomething else. Um, like again, I'm\ntalking about like you have to learn how\nto use the web application to actually\nlike have it be valuable.
