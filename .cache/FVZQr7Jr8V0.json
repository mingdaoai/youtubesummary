{"transcript": "there is a six-step formula to making a\nbreakthrough video that will blow up\nyour channel and she's proof that it\nworks I'll tell you what I do now and\nthen I'll tell you what I'm going to do\nin the future that's April in alter a\nYouTuber who abandoned her 20,000\nsubscriber channel to completely start\nover a year ago over that next 8 months\nshe tried everything but nothing worked\nuntil this is how to make a killer\nYouTube intro to blow up your channel\n755,000 views on a video posted with\nless than a th000 subscribers in this\nepisode she'll take us through the\nprocess of how it happened from ideation\nto upload so you can do it too thank you\nto artlist for sponsoring this\nvideo let's talk about your ideation\nprocess and how many ideas for videos\nyou have at any given time I definitely\nhave a very long laundry list of ideas\nnot as long as what I've heard from some\nof the big YouTubers have mine's\nprobably around 100 um i' say I have\naround a 100 ideas just kind of sitting\nin my backlog uh yeah at any one time\nhow do you narrow down the ideas that\nyou want to work on when you're moving\nthings along like how are you thinking\nnow we can use what you've learned now\nas to what is the most promising idea\nthat you want to move to the top of your\nlist so there are a couple of key things\nthat I normally check for when I think\nabout a video idea first I think about\nam I genuinely interested in making this\nidea if the answer is know it's probably\nnot going to be a good idea to make it\njust because so much effort goes into\nany single one video and I really do try\nto enjoy the process as much as possible\nso if I don't have that genuine\nexcitement um from the idea from the\nvery get-go it's probably not going to\nwork out that's kind of more from the\nemotional standpoint then there's a lot\nthat goes into the validation of an idea\nwhen I say validation what I mean is has\nlike is there any sort of proof of\nconcept that this video will work this\nvideo idea will work is there something\nthat I have done that has shown me that\nthis will work again or is there\nsomething that someone else has done\nthat has shown me that I can do it again\nbut in a slightly different way um so I\nlook for that validation to give me a\npretty good idea that okay if I were to\nmake this video at least there's some\nsort of proven potential there's some\nsort of ceiling that I can verify that\nif I were to execute on this 100% this\nis around kind of the cap of the views\non this video Once kind of those those\nare the big two kind of categories that\nI like to look at first um there's a lot\nmore later on when it comes to branding\nand making sure that it aligns with my\nindividual video recipe um making sure\nthat there is alignment there before\nmoving on but those are kind of the big\ntwo things that I normally check for\nvalidation is an interesting aspect that\nI hear from other YouTubers as well that\ngoes counter to what I think a lot of\ncreative people might think a lot of\npeople think like the best ideas are the\nones that are totally novel never been\ndone before and theoretically that makes\nsome sense but I also agree with you in\nthat there's a lot of value in finding\nexamples of similar videos or similar\ntopics that prove there's viewer\ninterest have you ever uh had an idea\nthat you really wanted to make but you\njust couldn't validate that there was uh\ninterest on it 100% absolutely\nabsolutely my most recent video is an\nexample of that which is like for the\noverachievers of YouTube I will say\nthough that I tend to balance when I\nthink about ideation and my channel as a\nwhole I've kind of broken it down into\nthree categories of videos there are the\nBanger videos if I'm looking for a video\nand the goal is to bring in views the\ngoal is to especially bring in views\nfrom new viewers or people who have no\nidea who I am that validation box needs\nto be ticked if that box is not ticked\nthen that the goal of the video if I'm\nif I'm measuring the success of the\nvideo from how many views from new\nviewers it gets I'm shooting myself in\nthe foot if I do not validate it but\nthat doesn't mean that every single\nvideo I make has to be validated I these\nother kind of two categories of videos\none I call connection videos the the\ngoal there is not to get as many views\nas possible the goal there is to connect\nwith my existing viewers on a deeper\nlevel that video doesn't have to be\nvalidated because the goal is to not\nhave a huge number of views right the\ngoal is to connect on a deeper level\nwith my existing audience and the final\ncategory is soul videos videos that we\nmake because we're creatives and we're\nhere because yes we want financial\nsuccess but we also want freedom and\ncreativity and the opportunity for self-\nexpression and sometimes you just really\nneed to make a video because you have\nsomething out there that you just want\nto say and for those again I don't at\nleast I don't believe that you need\nvalidation you need validation in order\nto make the videos that your heart wants\nto make yeah it's interesting it's like\na it's like a question of expectations\nyou know if you if you're going to go\nagainst if you're not going to have\nvalidation then it's an exercise and\nasking yourself am I okay with this\nvideo not hitting some theoretical\nnumber I have in my mind of what success\nwould be because we don't have a uh\nbasis for those expectations probably\nsetting ourselves up for disappointment\nmore than we need to yes absolutely with\nthe intros video why did that idea get\nchosen what did you see to say this is\nworth making yeah so I'll give some more\ncontext into that idea because where I\nam now is very different from where I\nwas in the making of that video at the\ntime I had maybe 747 subscribers so I I\nwas in the midst of a 90-day\nmonetization challenge so I was doing\neverything in my power to get my channel\nmonetized that means 1,000 subscribers\n4,000 watch hours within 90 days I was\naround halfway through my challenge at\nthat point and I had done a lot of I've\ntried a lot of different things I had\ntried making three videos in a week I\nhad tried slowing down and focusing more\non quality over quantity and I had tried\nlooking for things that other people had\ndone well that's kind of what my mindset\nwas at the time I was looking at what\nwhat topics are other people covering\nthat I could cover but in my own way for\nthe intro video that kind of changed\ninstead of looking for what topics other\npeople had done I looked within one of\nmy existing videos which was a little\nbit of a high performer for me again\neverything in context uh I had a a video\nthat had over a thousand views at that\ntime which for me again 747 subscribers\nthat was a bit of a high performer on my\nchannel that one went over kind of like\nuh I think the title is how Mr B solve\nYouTube or how Mr be solved YouTube\nretention and I broke that into chapters\nand there a number of different chapters\nbut one of the chapters was intros how\nhe treated intros and the retention on\nmy video for that particular chapter was\nquite high was the highest over the\nentire video and so I got to thinking\nand also some of my comments were\nspecifically calling out that section as\nparticularly interesting or useful so it\nwas a bit of an experiment for me for\nthe intro video of okay I have this kind\nof comprehensive video What If I just\ntook out this one section that had the\nhigh retention on a previous video of\nmine and took that and blew it up made\nit its own video get even deeper into\nthis sort of thing so that was kind of\nhow I chose the topic of let's talk\nabout YouTube intros I want to talk a\nlittle bit about packaging next and uh\nhow you thought about packaging this\nvideo once you've realized okay I'm\ngoing to go into this sliver of intros\nfrom this other video I'm going to make\nan entire video about it how did you go\nabout packaging that video so there is\nthis other video from this amazing\nCreator named John Dorman and he had\nthis video that I had watched like a\nyear prior called how to make a killer\nYouTube video parentheses to blow up\nyour channel and I had watched that\nvideo good like a year before and that\nvideo had always stuck out to me and I\nRevisited it and I looked at the\npackaging to I'm like why did this stand\nout to me so much there are a couple of\nkey things one was the word killer the\nadjective killer adjectives tend to do\npretty well in titles in general\nespecially superlatives things like you\nknow biggest or crazy or things like\nthat but the word killer was something\nthat I hadn't seen very much before and\nwe might get into this later but there's\nthis concept of remarkability\nof yes there is some degree of\nvalidation of how things worked before\nbut there's also the degree of\nremarkability in that other people\nprobably have not seen a lot of this\nbefore it's not mainstream and the word\nkiller to me as an adjective was quite\nremarkable M let's yoink that I really\nlike this idea what if instead of how to\nmake a killer video to blow up your\nchannel was how to make a killer intro\nto blow up your channel and then I was\nlike uh go going back and forth with a\nfriend of mine Jake Thomas um about that\nthat title because he is very good at\ntitles and he said what if instead of to\nblow up your channel in the parenthesis\nit was for the 2023 algorithm like H\nthat's interesting too and of put pulled\nthat in there with the thumbnail another\nelement of John Dorman's title and\nthumbnail his packaging that I really\nliked was the words up at the very top\nhis thumbnail text which for him I\nbelieve was you're one video away and I\nthought not just like okay those words\nare cool but why why do those really\nresonate with me and for me it was this\nfeeling of encouragement and inspiration\nthe idea that okay it's sure it's hard\nbut it is possible we do have the agency\nto make a change here and I wanted to do\nhave evoke a similar sort of feeling\nwith my thumbnail so for for me instead\nof your your one video away it became\nthis is all it takes the idea that okay\nkind to go with that title of this is a\nhow to make a killer intro this is all\nit takes to blow up a Channel or for the\nthe the the 20 2023 algorithm or\nwhatever it is and then kind of deeper\ninto that thumbnail as well I guess it\ndepends on how how deep you want to get\nuh but there are also a couple of key\nthings things I did there that were I\nwill say quite a bit risky I took a big\nrisk on this thumbnail because it was\nvery different from the thumbnails that\nI was seeing within this Niche a lot of\nmy thumbnails leading up to that point I\nwas kind of taking from the broader\nYouTube education ecosystem like it\ntended to be darker there tended to be a\nlot of red in black or white they tended\nto either be a graph or a number or you\nknow someone's giant face taking up part\nof it whether it's the Creator's face or\nwell-known other Creator faces for me I\nthought okay I'm talking about intros\nwhat is the best way I can visualize an\nintro and the idea that I had was we can\ntake a video timeline okay sh timeline\nlet's cut out just the beginning part\ncuz we're talking about intros great\nthat's not enough I want to draw more\nattention to it let's make it a\ndifferent color let's avoid the color\nred because let's try to be different\nlet's try to be remarkable let's go\nrainbow colors because I like it it\nlooks pretty and it stands out a little\nbit much that's that's not enough okay\ncan I have this text here let's even\nlet's draw even more attention to it\nlet's put an arrow I talk in my\nthumbnail video about the idea of\nthumbnail hierarchy and that you should\nreally kind of focus on what is the main\ncharacter of your thumbnail versus what\nare the supporting characters that's\nsomething that a lot of people get wrong\nthey believe that they are always the\nmain character of their thumbnails but\nthat's not necessarily true in my intro\nvideo I was not the main character I'm a\nsupporting character in that thumbnail\nto the intro so I do include myself but\nI'm quite small and if you look deeper\nyou can see that really the entire\nthumbnail is designed in a way to just\ndraw more attention draw the eye to that\nbeginning intro part so I'm small I'm\ncentered but I'm looking up I'm looking\ndirectly to that to that intro part\nthere's an arrow directly to that intro\npart and it all kind of comes together\nthe last thing I'll say is it's a more\nminimalistic thumbnail versus a lot of\nthe other ones that were seeing in the\nspace are more maximis and all of those\nfactors together came into the creation\nof my intro\nthumbnail wait what is going on hey I\nthought you guys could use a little\nAmbiance what do you think of this where\ndid you find this oh this song I got it\nfrom art list the sponsor of today's\nvideo art list is the best place to find\ncreative assets to level up your videos\nand it's super easy to use check this\nout let's go to artlist.io\nIO we'll click the footage\ntab scroll a bit until we see something\nwe\nlike uh okay let's check out this guy\nswimming when you click in on a video\nthumbnail there are two things to notice\nthe first is the suggested sound effects\nbox these are sounds that artless thinks\nwill go well with the footage you\nclicked on the second is you can scroll\na little and see that each video is part\nof a larger collection so you can piece\nmultiple shots together if you want to\nwhich is what we're going to do let's\ntake this shot of the Moon Over The\nWater this underwater\nshot and this one of him walking around\nin the pool let's head to the sound\neffects tab to get some Ambiance we'll\nsearch quiet night and\nnature perfect we'll use the first one\nthen I'll search soft water because\nwe're building a\nscene uh uh let's use this one then\nunderwater Ambiance for that second shot\nwe're going to use first one is perfect\nnow the music to set the mood let's\nsearch calm and\npeaceful look at that first one is\nperfect again let's put it together and\nsee what we\n[Music]\ngot it's that easy we use art list for\nall of our videos and absolutely love it\nand with art list Max we can get music\nsound effects footage and Motion\nGraphics for one price without having to\nworry about any of the licensing sign up\nwith our Link in the description and you\nwill get two months free on any annual\nplan thank you to artlist for supporting\nthe channel so that's what we see live\nnow was that the first title and the\nfirst thumbnail that you uploaded did\nyou have other concepts for this video\nit's a good question let me check out my\nfigma okay so this is like my massive\nfigma I use figma for like everything\nlike it is it's ridiculous it's also\nchaotic but my brain works like this so\nif we if we scroll into like this\nsection this is when you kind of get\ninto there really are not that many\nvariations here I do more variations in\nthe future now um but in the making of\nthis particular one I had this concept\nof the okay we have like this as the the\nthe original title was to your channel\nthe parenthesis it became for the 2023\nthen now for the 2024 algorithm I think\nthe overall concept of this is all it\ntakes as the text and the check mark and\nthe overall structure was something I\nwas pretty set on from the very\nbeginning I did some like whiteboard\nvariations of it on my on my physical\nwhiteboard to think about the overall\ncomposition and I really liked this one\nso I took this one and I ran with it in\nlike a digital version and there are a\ncouple of variations\nnot not as many as I normally do but\nlike okay one I'm centered but I'm like\nlooking at it this this this was my\noriginal idea the one that I like\nsketched out on my whiteboard of like oh\nlike a cool shot from the back and I was\nlike this looks like a mop that's not\ngoing to work that doesn't work very\nwell at all and then I'm like okay well\nI can can I can I look at it that if I'm\nface it so I took more pictures came\nback I'm like okay this this is starting\nto look good I did different different\nvariations of grading I was like well\nyou know think we could do a darker one\nand then I was like that doesn't look\nvery good at all this looks so weird I\ndidn't like that I didn't like the red\neither I like the pink better than the\nred um just because it stood out to me a\nlittle bit more I played around with\ndifferent pictures of myself but\nultimately I just went with the kind of\noriginal like one of I think this one um\nI like the more up close version of\nmyself versus the further away version\nand that's just the one I went with so\ninteresting to hear you describe your\nthought process as you're going through\nthis because I think a lot of people can\nrelate to this you're an interesting\ncase because now you've done uh a 33\nminute deep dive on thumbnail so you\nhave more thumbnail knowledge than the\naverage person but as you're describing\nthis there's a lot of I liked I felt\nthis way and there's probably a\nsubconscious level of you that\nunderstands why you liked this versus\nthis or why this seemed better than this\nyou could you could intellectualize it\nbut it also sounds like you were\ntrusting your gut in terms of what feels\nright what looks good I can see on the\nright you have like this this mockup of\nthe YouTube homepage so I imagine you're\ndragging your own thumbnails into that\nand comparing it against the other\nthings that you would see so it sounds\nlike at the time you were trusting your\nown taste a little bit did you did you\nshare this with anybody else to get\ntheir feedback in real time 100% so at\nthe time I was just starting this\nYouTube Mastermind that I have now it's\nit's grown a little bit from then we\nhave four people now including myself um\nbut back then it was just me and my\nfriend Stella and so it was just us and\nwe met up together for two hours every\nsingle week just to talk through YouTube\nand to give each other feedback and ask\nquestions and all of that fun stuff um\nand we were in our weekly sessions and I\nwas working on this next video and I\nshowed her the the thumbnails and got\nher opinions on it I also asked uh my\npartner Rox he didn't like it very much\nhe was like H I'm not really the right\nperson to ask I don't really know these\ntypes of aesthetic thumbnails uh so his\nhis his opinion was kind of Mo which I\nthink is a good point in that you can\nask a lot of people for feedback but you\ndo have to put all of their feedback in\nthe context of what they know and what\nthey're interested in and what their own\ntaste is because taste is also a factor\nthat we kind of alluded to that is going\nto change between different people so I\nlooked at this and I thought okay my gut\nis I think this is interesting I'm a\nlittle bit scared because it's risky I\nhaven't done anything like this before I\nhaven't seen anything like this before\nbut in that kind of like YouTube mockup\nscreenshot that I had I thought oh this\nis interesting my picture of myself my\nthumbnail tends to stand out when I look\nat this just because it's so different\nfrom what I'm normally seeing on the\nYouTube homepage I asked my my friend\nabout it she also really liked it and so\nI was like okay it's not just me I might\nbe a little bit delusional but at least\nthe two of us are delusional together if\nwe both think that this is good um and\ntwo is better than one so I did get a\nlittle bit of feedback on that as well\nsomething I really admire and respect\nabout your work is the level of research\nthat you do and you use the amount of\nresearch that you do as a signal for\ninput bias in a lot of your videos which\nwe'll talk about in a little bit but\nwhen you are doing the packaging process\nfor videos maybe now that you're\nthinking about when you have an idea\nthat you're excited about but now you're\nthinking about packaging how do you\nresearch these ideas for packaging how\ndo you research titles how do you\nresearch thumbnails that you think can\nserve as inspiration I think that's a\nthat's a point of friction for a lot of\npeople is saying I have this idea I have\nto come up with a package how do I think\nabout the best title how do I think\nabout the best thumbnail where where's\nyour head go I will say my my my process\nnow is a bit different from what it was\nwhen I made that first video because I\njust I know a lot more that's the kind\nof beauty about being within this Niche\nwhich I'm sure you might relate to as\nwell is that the more we learn the more\nwe're able to apply to our own videos to\nbecome better which is just a super cool\nfeedback loop like I love my job so much\num so I I've learned a lot and now I\nthink my process is different one one\namazing place that I like to use uh one\namazing tool that I like to use is the\ntool one of 10 um which you may have\nheard about before it is an outlier tool\nand I love one of 10 because it's just\nkind of like you can type in a topic and\nit just shows all of the outlier videos\nwhat that means it's like a video that\nis far like far overperformed the\naverage for that channel and just shows\nall of them related to a specific topic\nall at once that's made the process a\nlot easier when I'm thinking about\nsomething like can I put this in but I\nwill say that there is this kind\nof push and pull of how much do you want\nto take inspiration from what has proven\nto work versus how much do you just want\nto go into it yourself I usually like to\nstart by seeing what I come up with\nmyself before I'm influenced by anything\nelse so I start there um drop down some\nConcepts I start with kind of the\nCuriosity Gap I guess I I take a much\nmore holistic view to titles and\nthumbnails now when you look at an\noutlier you don't necessarily know why\nthat outlier is an outlier you have to\ndig a lot deeper into okay like is this\nan outlier because of its idea this\ntopic is this an outlier because of its\npackaging is it an outlier because of\nits content itself is it an outlier\nbecause of timing right it's like which\njust kind of goes into topic right you\nhave to get really deep into these\nthings or else it's very easy to start\npulling stuff that you assume is good\nbut actually isn't good from an outlier\nand even when you're thinking about why\nis this an outlier that's still\nassumptions that you're making they can\nbe educated guesses but this is this is\nthe hard thing about this typee of work\nis you can see data and data tells you\nsomething and then you start to like\nassume a story based on the data but you\nmight be wrong you might think this\nperformed really well because the\npackage was really great and then you\nyoink packaging inspiration from this\nand your video doesn't do well because\nit turns out maybe that wasn't why that\nvideo outperformed maybe it wasn't the\npackage at all but that assumption now\nhas led you down potentially the wrong\npath it's hard to know that's a hard\nthing about looking at data and making\nassumptions from it but but uh there's\nnot really a different way yeah well I\nmean and that's and that's and that's\nwhy I think that I think there is a\nslightly different way which is don't\njust take like I I I would avoid just\ntaking from a single piece of data right\nand thinking like okay this is\ninteresting let's take from this I like\nto view things as a whole right like\nokay what sort of patterns am I seeing\nacross lots of these things because then\nthen your educated guesses become a\nlittle bit more educated okay it's not\njust\nit's not just this this sort of like\nthis these text or this words here it's\nalso here and here and here and here and\nalso I would say you don't have to just\nlook within your individual niche as\nwell when I went into a lot of the\nresearch for my thumbnail video right I\nwas looking across as many thumbnails as\nI could across many different types of\nniches across YouTube and there were\ncertain formats or types of thumbnails\nthat tended to perform well regardless\nof Niche right like a typical\ntransformation thumbnail right you have\na before you have an after that can be\nthe case when whether you're in the\nYouTube education space or if you're in\nthe health and fitness phas phase or if\nyou're doing a a a room\ntransformation video or nearly anything\nelse can be applied uh to this\ntransformation before and after\nthumbnail format and there are a couple\nof other key formats that are repeatable\nacross a variety of different niches and\ndo work across a variety of different\nniches because there's something\npsychological drawing us to those things\na lot of that also goes into feeling so\nthere's a reason why we are interested\nin these things are we curious about\ncuriosity is usually a strong driver um\nbut also desire can be a strong driver\nas well if you like show something on I\ncall those result result thumbnails if\nyou show a result on your thumbnail that\nis very desirable and people want to\nclick because they want that result I\nthink when you have a more holistic view\nabout thumbnails and packaging in\ngeneral you don't like outliers are\nincredible and that is one tool and then\nyou start to like piece everything else\ntogether in a way that can create your\nvery own thumbnail and one that is\nunique to you and how's the chance of\nbeing remarkable as opposed to just\nbeing drowned out in the sea of what\neveryone else is making I like your\npoint about taking data points in\naggregate to Der risk uh the assumptions\nthat you're making I heard a story\nrecently of a professor well first of\nall there's this there's there's this\npaper called the wisdom of crowds and\nit's like decades old that talks about\nhow when you have more data points the\ndata becomes more accurate and there's a\nprofessor who would start his class by\nlike having uh a jar of jelly beans and\ntell people to guess how many jelly\nbeans are in this jar and on an\nindividual basis the average individual\nwas off by like 50% but in aggregate\nwhen you controlled for how many people\nguessed the group guess calculated\ntogether was only 15% off so anytime\nthat you can look at more data um I like\nthat as a way to make a more educated\nguess okay so we have where the idea\ncame from we went into packaging we\ngreenl this greenlit this we said we're\ngoing to go talk to me about your\nresearch and scripting process because\nI've seen the research documents that\nyou've done sometimes 70 plus pages long\ntalk to me about how you go into these\nprocesses and when you know that you're\ndone sometimes I can get carried away\nwith research partially because I love\nit um the document that I have on my\nmost on the video that I'm working on\nright now about ideation is 180 Pages\nnow so I think it's around done now\nwhich is good I'll I'll split those up\nbetween uh research and scripting so\nwhen it comes to my research process\nthere are two phases es of my research\none is information collection and the\nother is information\nconnection when it's when we're in the\ninformation collection phase it's truly\nconsuming as much information as I can\nabout a certain topic like as is\npossible so I'll start by going into my\nprevious gigantic research docs and\npulling from there like okay I know\nother things I have talked about um I\nI've researched before have talked about\nthis certain topic let's pull in those\nlike those bullet points from there I'll\nlook into into new things I'll usually\ntake from a variety of sources I'll\nstart off by taking from interviews I\nlove primary primary sources of\ninformation so it's like if I can hear a\nCreator talking about their own\nindividual uh process like I'll take\nfrom that first so after I've exhausted\na lot of the interviews that I can find\nthen I'll move into videos like okay\nwhat videos have other people made on\nthis top topic what are they talking\nabout let's pull in from there after\nthat I take from things outside of\nYouTube so either take from like Twitter\nthreads that people send me that I think\nare really interesting and I'll take\nfrom outside of YouTube as well in this\nideation video that I'm working on now\num yes there's a lot of information on\nYouTube about ideation but a lot of what\nI've taken has come from not just\nYouTube but also film and Science\nFiction and Fantasy writing and game\ndevelopment because these Industries\nhave been around a lot longer than\nYouTube has and there might be some like\nnew pieces of information there not new\nbut new to YouTube pieces of information\nI can take there and apply and then I'll\nalso conduct my own interviews sometimes\nwhere I have I'm lucky enough to have\ndifferent friends in the YouTube space\nso when they know that I'm working on\nsomething if they're interested I can\ninterview them and ask them point of\nquestions about what their own process\nis like and record those so that is my\ninformation collection phase just\ncollecting as much information as I can\ntimestamping all of the bullet points on\nmy notes so I can go back to them you\nhave a question all right what what\ncomes next after collection so after\nCollection comes connection so after I\nhave all of this information you ask\nlike about about when I think I'm done\nwith the at least the collection phase\nusually it's it's when my mind is so\nready to to jump into the connection\nphase like I've been consuming a lot of\ninformation I'll usually have like a uh\nlike friends will send me things or I'll\nsee things and just like add it to my\nlist of like make sure to check out\nlater um once I've exhausted that list\nand like no new stuff has made it onto\nthat that list I'm like okay I'm done\nthen I'll move into the con the\nconnection phase and there are also a\ncouple of phases within this connection\nphase first is the condensing phase so I\nhave all of this information again like\nlots of bullet points and everything and\nI take those like huge notes and then I\ncondense it into okay other types of\nnotes uh that is\na lot less fluff right so that I kind of\nsort between this is something that's\nnot relevant this this is the stuff that\nis relevant after that then I'll go into\nmy bucket stage um which is like the the\nmain part of the connection phase which\nis I go through all my sources of of\ninformation I'll do like a dual screen\nso I have my notes on one side and then\nmy notes further down on the other side\nand I'll take each bullet from my\ncondensed notes and sort it into a\nbucket and each bucket of is like a\ndifferent topic so in ideation one\nbucket could be inspiration one bucket\ncan be outliers one bucket can be you\nknow how how to stay original and I have\nall of these buckets that I kind of see\npatterns between if I have a bullet that\ndoesn't fit into a bucket I'll either\nmake a new bucket for it or put it in\nthe IDK where this goes bucket and come\nto it later I'll put everything into\nbuckets and that's like one of the most\nmagical parts of this process for me\nbecause then I can see how different\nthings that people have said at\ndifferent times can kind of all feed\ninto each other and align within certain\nbuckets and that's just it's just it's\nso cool it's so cool to see all of it\ncome together sounds very useful for\nstructure yes absolutely which is then\nkind of we can go into the outlining\nstage so after I have all of my buckets\nthen you ask about feedback that's\nthat's like a crucial feedback point for\nme I'll have all of these buckets like\neverything sorted into buckets I might\nhave like an idea of like a general\noutline and then I'll bring a friend on\nlike hey\nokay I have all of this information\nsorted into buckets can we go through\nthis together and give me your thoughts\nand what she'll tell me is either you\nknow when something is particularly like\nneat or useful to her when something is\nnew to her so she hasn't heard it before\nwhich is really great information um\nwhat she has more questions on what she\nlike lights up about and says I should\ntalk about more what she's like H I\ndon't think this is that relevant and\nI'll take all of the notes about what\nhow feels about all the information\nwithin my buckets and then from that\nI'll turn that into an outline for my\nvideo do you ever get to a point where\nyou have some number of buckets and you\nget in that feedback phase and\nsomebody's like this is not interesting\nand the the feedback is telling you to\ncut something that you've become like\nattached to yeah the it's I'm usually\nnot attached to things that other people\ndon't find interesting what happens more\noften is you know they'll get really\ninterested in one thing and then say Oh\nbut that's probably its own video um You\nprobably shouldn't include it here\nbecause it's it's its own video and that\nthat's what happens more frequently\nusually if I think it should really\nbelong and it needs to belong I'll use\nthat logic I'm like okay well I can\ninclude it just like in you know intros\nI had intros included in the Mr Beast\nsolve YouTube video but also was its own\nvideo I could do that too so I could\ninclude maybe like a three minute\nsection like portion of it in this video\nand then later on can blow it up and\nmake it its own video if you think it's\nyou know that informational so you you\nhave this outline you've gotten feedback\non it when it comes to filling out that\noutline and creating a script what do\nyou think are the most important areas\nthat you're directing your time and\nattention to my my script writing\nprocess goes through a couple of\ndifferent versions version one is always\nthe April in is sad version where it\nit's just so hard to get started and to\nstart\nwriting um and I just I just like word\nvomit and so like I I will for it's it's\nalways torture to write the first\nversion of my script it's always like\nthe worst writing I have ever written I\nhave to like listen to music or watch\nsomething else while I do it so I don't\nthink about what I'm writing and I\nstopped multiple times saying this is\nthe worst thing I've ever written this\nis a terrible video no one's going to\nCare this is going to be horrible um so\nversion one is always like sad April in\nversion um but it's necessary because\nthat's just the beginning uh and then\nfrom there I start to go through and\nlike edit and edit and edit and add\nthings and edit also in my in my first\ndraft I will say just like a tip that I\ndo to help me go along is whenever I get\nstuck usually this comes into you know\nwhen I want to talk about something but\nI haven't done like I don't want to get\nvery deep into it I'll just put these in\nparentheses like talk about this thing\nhere mention this this this and this um\nor El say like put example about this\nthing here so I can allows me to move\nthrough that sad aprin script phase\nquicker without being stuck into it and\nthen kind of as I go through I go\nthrough in each stage and I come back to\nthose parentheses and I start to fill\nthem out sometimes I'll put like more\nparentheses I'll fill stuff out and like\nokay well make sure to conclude this\nbetter here I'll leave myself notes as\nwell um so just like not stuck in my\nhead of like okay this is bad and I just\nlike put a comment to myself if this is\nbad rework later as I continue to go\nthrough I was like in terms of what I\ntypically look for or optimize for when\nI script there are a couple of things\none I mean intros are just super\nimportant I spent a lot of time on my\nintros making sure that my intros hit\nreally really really hard I want to make\nsure that obviously number one is the in\nthe the the quality of information is\nexceptional it has to be something that\npeople hear it and they're like wow um\nthis is amazing this is great\ninformation beyond that I want the\nscript to feel good I optimize a lot for\nfeeling uh you we we kind of have this\nconcept in design called ux right the\nthe user experience of it not just how a\ndesign looks like but how it feels to\nuse and I treat my scripts very\nsimilarly like how how does this script\nfeel to read does everything flow into\neach other quite neatly or are there\nlike Jagged edges that don't feel as\ngreat there things that people snag on I\nwant to make sure that those are all\nsmoothed out and it feels nice to go\nthrough um things like humor and jokes\nkind of like add to that feeling as well\nand I always make sure that at the end\nwe leave on a high note it's\ninspirational it's encouraging I want\npeople leaving feeling like wow that was\na whole lot of video there's a lot to\nwork on but I can do it and then finally\nI make sure again to go back to my my\ngroup share my script and see where they\nget bored or fatigued especially in\neducational videos when you have so much\ninformation it can get quite dense I\nnever want people to get fatigued while\nthey watch it so how do I make sure that\nI alternate between this is a lot of\ninformation but then you don't have to\nfocus as much because we get to like\nwatch something or watch it applied and\nthen there's this alternation of moments\nof like dense information versus lighter\ninformation high energy versus low\nenergy and making sure that that all\nfeels good throughout the entire portion\nof the script the success of this\nvideo leads me to believe that retention\nwas really good at least relative to\nother videos on the channel what if you\nreflect on it what about the structure\nor the script of this video do you think\nhelped retention there are a couple of\nthings I think one in the very beginning\nuh introducing something as a formula so\nlike a like a four-step formula or like\nfour parts of that instantly creates\nthis desire to stick around to to the\nend because you don't just want to hear\nyou know the first two parts of a\nformula like you want to hear all four\nparts of the formula so by by being very\nspecific with that promise of what\nexactly we're going to cover um how many\nsteps that tends to inherently be a\nretention improver beyond that as well\nkind of like again breaking everything\ninto sub formulas each part tends to be\na sub formula So within each of those\nfour steps right we tend to uh use that\nprinciple more than once it's not just\ngreat for retention is also great in\nterms of accessibility of information it\nhelps people organize the information\nbetter which is great also when it go\ninto kind of like high energy and low\nenergy there's this this alternation\nthat tends to happen of uh introduce a\nprinciple and then see that principle in\naction in an intro right then introduce\nthe next principle and Seed an action\nand intros are inherently High retention\nbecause other people's successful intros\nare made to be interesting so by\nbreaking that down right you have not\nonly like heyy I get to see this\nprinciple in action I know that steps\nare being taken but also I want to see\nthe rest of this intro because this\nintro seems interesting like like the\none that I'm analyzing through the\ncourse of my video people want it to be\ncomplete we're talking about an intro\nyou don't want to just stop at I guess\nthis goes back to formulas but you don't\nwant to just stop in the middle of an\nintro you want to see how the entire\nthing plays out it also helps that it's\ntruly useful information right if\nsomeone clicks you think about the\nreason why someone clicks on the video\nthey usually click on it because they\nwant to improve their own intro and as\nlong as I can show in the very beginning\nand kind of like frontload value as much\nas I can um it's okay if the future\nstuff is in in the video is a little bit\nless interesting or a little bit more\nboring but still useful as long as the\nbeginning points hopefully it can make\nlike an aha moment happen within the\nfirst 3 minutes of to help them continue\non and convince them that it's going to\nbe worth it I want to talk a little bit\nabout editing but only only a little bit\nfor you know what people sometimes call\nlike talking head videos I find that\nyour\nvideos have more b-roll more onscreen\ntext more animations than is common so\nI'd love to hear just your mindset when\nyou go into an edit on how you think\nabout how often you change the frame or\nwhen you use onscreen text or animation\nbecause you use a lot of it and I'm\nwondering what level of intentionality\nyou have there so there there's this\ncrucial crucial step that happens\nbetween scripting and filming um and my\nintro video I believe was the was the\nfirst video where I started to do this\nand it shows which is I have an\nannotation phase and so before I film I\ngo through my finished script and I\ncomment out on every single line or\nphrase or word heard what I want to have\nhappen on screen during that time and I\nhave that all written out and then I\nkind of uh convert that into at least\nlike the parts that I have uh want to\nfilm I turn that into a shot list and\nbetween those things the the main things\nthat I comment out are one if it's\ntalking head footage right if it's going\nto be me on screen like this talking to\nyou uh two if it's text so I want if I\nwant like text like full screen text on\nscreen three if it's e roll um or like\nsomething else that I have to film not\nmy talking head footage but something\nelse that I'm filming um in four\nanimations so like some sort of like\nillustration or animation that I'm going\nto be making those are typically the\nfour categories of stuff that I have in\nmy videos or at least visual stuff that\nI have in my videos and I sort\neverything between those four things and\nthat makes the editing well first\nfilming process so much easier because I\ndon't like I know exactly what to film\nbeforehand I can go off and film all the\nbureau that I need because I have a list\nof that which is just so useful in the\nediting process like no also the editing\nprocess becomes a lot less of critical\nthinking about what needs to go here and\na lot more of just execution so I've\nalready pre-loaded that work I've\nalready done that work beforehand of the\ncritical thinking of what needs to go\nwhere so the video is done it's shot\nit's ready is there anything worth\nmentioning about the actual upload or\npublish process that's a part of your\nprocess that people might not uh\nproperly understand or value two things\none I do like to include time stamps I\nknow some people don't like to include\ntimestamps because they think that it\nmight hurt their retention um personally\nI like including timestamps because it's\nan educational video I want people to be\nable to jump around also it's just good\ninformation for me to know like okay are\npeople jumping to a particular chapter\nor not like do I see like a spike on a\nparticular chapter or not that just good\ninformation I think it's worth any\npotential\ndownside and retention I haven't\nexperienced downside and retention but\nthat's one thing second thing is ADD\nplacement I know this will only apply to\nthe people who are monetized but this\nblew my mind when I heard about it\nnormally YouTube autop places your ads\nand you're like oh it's fine just autop\nplace it no instead you go through and\nyou put down each individual ad and do\nso around every 2 to three minutes you\nmight think aprin that's ridiculous no\none's going to watch All Those ads\nhere's the kicker they won't see all of\nthe ads uh YouTube doesn't put an ad\nthere just because you say this is an ad\nbreak all you do when you when you put\nlike an ad break on your video is give\nYouTube the opportunity to place an ad\nthere and this becomes really crucial\nbecause YouTube has their own algorithm\nfor determining when they show an ad\ndependent not just on your video but on\nthe viewer's entire viewing experience\nas a whole so if someone watches a video\nright before yours and they're shown an\nad close to the end of their video and\nthen then your video comes in they might\nlike like if the ad break that you have\nin your video is towards the beginning\nthat YouTube Auto places they might\nnever see that ad because in the overall\nscheme of it that's not enough time\nversus if you put your ad breaks the\nopportunities for ad breaks every 2 to 3\nminutes you're they're almost guaranteed\nthat they're going to be shown an ad but\nit'll probably be in the latter half of\nyour video or in the beginning of your\nvideo depending on the again their\noverall viewing experience but when I\ndid that uh I hope I hope that's sense\nbut when I did this I saw that my my\nAdSense doubled it doubled overnight\njust by placing um ads manually every\ntwo to three minutes this is hard to\nknow but I'm interested to hear your\nworking opinions on why this video was\nsuch a high performer for your channel\num what what you did differently or what\nmight have been perceived differently\nany opinions you have do think the\npackaging was quite good and to to go\nback to that uh concept of remarkability\none last time it it was remarkable it\nwas a remarkable packaging in in this\nYouTube education space people had not\nseen something like that before if you\nknow or or in a very very long time and\nso first of all the packaging stood out\nand it did a really great job at\ncreating curiosity the topic was also\nrelatively novel too because there\nweren't a lot of other people people\ntalking about\nintros in general in the YouTube\neducation space in that meta so with all\nof those factors together it became a\nvery clickable video again the topic was\nrelatively novel and interesting and the\npackaging was remarkable and also draw\nof curiosity so that succeeded in\nCatching attention and getting the click\nwhen it comes to the video itself the\nintro was a big factor it's a kind of\nmeta but a video about an intro of\ncourse people are going to judge the\nintro of that video so much and determin\ntheir decision of whether or not to\ncontinue watching based on how good my\nown intro was for that video I might be\na little bit overconfident here but I\nthink that for one the information that\nI provided again was relatively novel I\nhadn't heard a lot of other people break\ndown intros in specifically that way\nbefore ever and so that was a lot of\npeople's first time hearing about the\nformula or makeup of a good intro that\nwas mind-boggling to them a lot of aha\nmoments were made and my style was very\ndifferent in that video as well as you\nmentioned right it's not just talking\nhead but it's a lot of animations and a\nlot of like Beal filmed kind of like\nreactions and that was relatively novel\nin the space as well people don't tend\nto do that a lot and finally when it\ncomes to the end right just like making\nsure that they end on a high note and on\na like encouraging inspirational note I\nhave that infographic that I put in in\nthere as well just like you can get this\nfor free as well truly just like trying\nto give this video as a gift to my\nviewers and that's really how I view all\nof my videos but so much love poured\ninto it like I want this to be a\nphenomenal gift to my viewers to just be\nable to enjoy and use and I think all of\nthose factors Together made for a banger\nvideo and you can make a banger video\ntoo but that starts with a great idea if\nyou want to come up with an idea that\nwill blow up your Channel watch this\ninterview with Patty Galloway a YouTube\nstrategist who has worked with clients\nlike Mr Beast and Ryan Tran where he\nbreaks down exactly how to do that\n[Music]", "language": "en-US"}
