{"transcript": "I'm a solo app developer who just spent\nover $2,000 on marketing his apps on\nsocial media, primarily on Facebook,\nMeta, Instagram, all that jazz. And in\nthis video, I'm going to talk about how\nexactly that all went and whether it was\nworth it or not. So, just for a little\nbit of clarification, I am a solo app\ndeveloper, but I do have a co-founder.\nHe's a marketing co-founder. So, I'm not\na solopreneur. I'm just the sole\ntechnical person. I do all of the\nbuilding. And my co-founder, Ming Mang\nDuck, on social media, he is the main\nmarketing person for organic social\nmedia primarily. But recently, we\ndecided to try out paid ads,\nspecifically meta ads. I have never\nreally done too much paid ads because I\nprimarily in the past when I was truly a\nsoloreneur, I only marketed my apps on\norganic social media. But my partner has\ndabbled a little bit in the paid ad\nspace in the past when he used to do\nsome drop shipping e-commerce stuff. So,\nhe knows the platform a little bit\nbetter than me. So, throughout this\nvideo, he's going to jump in here and\nthere to explain what exactly our ad\nstrategy was or what specifically his ad\nstrategy was on how we ran ads for our\nproduct. And then I'll also chime in a\nlittle bit about my general thoughts\nabout paid ads as well. So just for some\ncontext, what app do we run paid ads\nfor? So we are currently building an app\ncalled perfectin.ai. It is basically a\nsuite of tools that helps people get\njobs. A lot of them are AI powered, but\nthat's the general gist. We have a\nreally fast resume builder. We have an\ninterview prepping tool as well as an\ninterview co-pilot tool that listens in\non your meetings and answers interview\nquestions for you. So that's the tool\nthat we're building and we're in the job\nsearch market. And for the past couple\nof months, we've been pretty regularly\nable to hit like\n$1,1500 a month of revenue purely from\norganic social media. But then we\ndecided, okay, why not try out this paid\nads thing? Maybe paid ads can help\nelevate us to the next level of users\nand revenue milestone. And when you\nthink about the concept of paid ads, it\nsounds like a dream, like a match made\nin heaven. It's like, oh my gosh, I just\npay for views and then as people see my\nads, maybe someone will convert. And\nthen you can essentially theoretically\nif your ad and your funnel and your\nlanding page and all that is good\nenough. You can theoretically create\nlike money printer where you put in $1\nand then the money printer spits out\nthree or$4 dollars out the back. That\nsounds crazy. But is it actually that\neasy? In my experience, no. And we'll go\na little bit more into detail as to why.\nSo right now I'm going to switch over to\nmy partner Mang Doug. I'll let him do\ndeeper dive into how exactly the\ncampaigns were set up. All right. So we\nare currently chatting with my\nco-founder Andrew. also goes by Mangmuck\non social media. He has been running\npaid ads for our SAS tool, Perfect\nInterview.AI for the past month, month\nand a half. Spent a little bit over two\ngrand dropping money on paid ads. He\nhandled everything. So, in this segment\nof the video, we're just going to kind\nof go over the general campaign setup.\nLike, there's going to be some things\nthat we're going to be like, \"Yeah, I\ndon't know why we did that. We just did\nit.\" We're just going to show you our\nexact setup, our quote unquote strategy,\nif we even have any. But, yeah, we're\njust going to go over it all. So,\nAndrew, why don't you take it away, dive\ninto the meta ads dashboard and tell us\na little bit about how everything was\nset up. Well, first things first, of\ncourse, there's a strategy behind all of\nthis. Um, it would be not great idea if\nwe went in without any strategy at all\nwhat we're trying to do, but Yeah. Yeah.\nAll right. Well, number one, hey guys,\nhappy to be featured on this channel.\nVery excited to talk about paid ads\ntoday. I'll say me personally, I'm not\nan expert in paid ads. My expertise is\nmostly in organic content going viral on\norganic social media. I used to run a\nmarketing agency where I basically\nhelped like AI SAS brands go viral\norganically on Tik Tok, Instagram being\ntoo short. But I have a little knowledge\nin paid ads because in the past I used\nto do drop shipping which I ran a lot of\nads on Facebook, Instagram and did that\nfor pretty much two years and spent over\nsix figures on paid ads alone. Let me\njust share my screen here. So this is\nour dashboard for our ad account for a\nperfect interview. The most important\nthing that you want to be doing when\nyou're running paid ads is you first you\nwant to start out with testing ad\ncreatives. So the first campaign we had\ndown here is our ad creative testing\ncampaign. And you're going to see a lot\nof ad systems in here. But the most\nimportant thing is you have campaigns,\nyou have adsets, and then you have ad\ncreatives. And what the campaign\nbasically means is that that is your\noverarching umbrella for a campaign\nyou're running, right? And then within a\ncampaign you have different adsets. And\neach of these adsets generally what it\nmeans is that you're targeting different\naudience pockets. So you can select\naudience region, audience age, audience\nplatforms and overall meta will also\nhelp you find different audience pockets\nfor you. Even if let's say you have two\nadsets that exactly the same type of\nlike audience targeting, they'll also\nfind different pockets within those each\nof those audience pockets. So, I like to\nthink about adsets as like different\naudience pockets. And within each adset,\nyou can have ad creatives. And these are\njust like the videos you're going to be\nrunning on social media as like your\nyour ads, right? So, how I like to set\nup things is initially I like to have a\ntesting campaign where I come in here\nand there's a bunch of assets here right\nnow because I start to add more over\ntime as I'm like turning on and off\ndifferent adsets. But generally to\nstart, I like having three adsets. And\nwithin each of these three adsets, I\nwill test out one, two, three creatives.\nIdeally, you're testing out obviously\nmore than one creative cuz you want to\nbe split testing your creatives to see\nwhich one has performed better meta ads.\nAnd then eventually after you test out\nall these different creatives and you\nsee which one is kind of like your\nquoteunquote winning creative, you can\nthen throw that into a new campaign and\njust start like testing out different\nbudget ranges, different audience\ntargeting, and just start scaling up\nfrom there. So, I'm going to take a\nquick pause there. Is anything anything\nI said that may have been like confusing\nor I kind of breezed over? Yeah. So, I\nguess one question I have there is if\nyou have like let's say you have this\ncampaign, you have all these ad groups\nand then you find that one creative does\nreally well. Why would you create a\nbrand new campaign to pour more money\ninto it? Why not just, you know, juice\nup the existing ad set or the existing\nad within the existing campaign you\nalready created? I I think this goes\ninto like different schools of thought.\nSo, first things first, the rule of meta\nads and just kind of like the rule of\nsocial media in general is test, try\ndifferent things cuz what works for you\nmay not work for someone else and what\nworks for someone else may not work for\nyou, right? So, first thing first, what\nyou said there isn't wrong. You could\n100% do that. But I personally like\nfinding having a campaign where I'm just\ntesting out different ad creatives and\nthen when I find something that works, I\nthrow it into a new campaign to kind of\nhave like a nice separation, a nice\nclean Facebook ad dashboard cuz one of\nthe most important things on Facebook ad\nis it can get confusing very quickly as\nwell. As you can see here, it got it got\nfor me even now it still got messy very\nquickly and that's because I was\nactually like testing out different\ntypes of strategies like for the one you\njust mentioned eventually I start doing\nthat. I just start like pumping out new\nadsets, increasing budgets, and just\nrunning new advertisements within like\nthe same campaign. But to start out,\nwhat I like doing was I just like having\nthat separation of like I have a\ncampaign for testing out ad creatives\nitself. And I'm going to have a new\ncampaign that if I know ad creative\nworks, I'm just going to have a new\ncampaign that focuses on that specific\ncreative. So for example, this one, all\nthese adsets are running the exact same\nad creative, which is ad one quotequote\nwinning ad creative. So in that\ncampaign, you just said that you had\nlike five different adets, but each ad\nset had the same exact ad creative and\nif I recall correctly, had the same\nexact targeting as well. What's the\nstrategy behind multiple adsets with the\nsame ad? Yeah. So my thought process is\neach of these adsets are going to even\nthough they targeting the exact same\ndemographic and audience. So for example\nthis one if we click into it it is\ntargeting I call it big five or everyone\ncalls it big five which just means\nUnited States, New Zealand, United\nKingdom, Canada, Australia and I'm doing\nall broad targeting. So you know I'm not\ntargeting any specific interests or any\nspecific age group either. But each of\nthese adsets meta is going to go out\nthere and find different pockets of\naudiences for you. So, what I'm trying\nto do here is I'm trying to have more\nvariety of audience pockets just in case\nsome of them convert better than others,\nright? Cuz different audience pockets\nare generally going to convert\ndifferently from the other ones. What\nthese campaigns actually are is that\nthey're also CPOS, which means they're\ncampaign budget optimizations. That\nmeans you're giving the budget on the\ncampaign level and then Meta is going to\ngo into the campaign and it be spending\nthe budget based on which audience\npocket slash adset they think is going\nto be performing the best. So in this\ncase obviously we give it like five\ndifferent adsets and you can see like\nit's not equal spend across all these\ndifferent adsets cuz Meta is optimizing\nfor what they think is like the best\naudience pockets that's going to get you\nthe most views, impressions, conversions\nand all that stuff. Got it. And then I\nassume like let's say we find one that's\nlike really really crushing it. Like\nlet's say in this example right here,\nads set 5, it had the best purchase row\nads of 1.26. Like theoretically, let's\nsay it was even better than that. It was\nlike a 3.0 or a 4.0 or a 5.0. Then in\nthat scenario, would you have shut off\nall the other adsets? Then that would\nforce like the campaign budget\noptimization to funnel all the spend\nonto that adset that's converting really\nwell. So generally, I'll say meta ads is\npretty good at this point. being able to\nfunnel the spend into the adset that's\nperforming the best. You could do that,\nbut unless you see Meta is terribly\nspending towards some of the adsets that\nare just losing money, some of the best\npractice actually to not touch it too\nmuch cuz whenever you start turning off\nand things on meta ads, meta can end up\ntaking, you know, a day or two to like\nreoptimize the campaign for you and you\nmight lose out on like some purchases.\nBecause if you think about it in meta\nalgorithm, every single time you start\ntweaking things, it needs to reset\nitself being like, \"Okay, the situation\nhas changed. How am I going to adapt to\nthis new change?\" Right? All in all,\nit's not that deep. You could 100% do\nthat. But unless you see Meta just like\nhorribly spending, you know, your ad\nbudget towards like a different asset\nthat just isn't getting conversions,\nthen you can definitely turn it off.\nLike in this case, eventually I just\nturned off this campaign all and off\nbecause like the campaign as a whole\njust wasn't getting conversions. But\nlet's say I kept on running this, I\nwould have turned off adset 4 and adset\nthree because look, it spent $60 and $30\nand then it got literally no\nconversions. So if I kept on running\nthis campaign theory, I would have\nturned off these other two. But just\noverall like I didn't see much return\nfrom this campaign itself. So I decided\nto turn everything off. Got it. Got it.\nSo then it seems like the general or\nhigher highlevel strategy of how you set\nup paid ads for our SAS is just have one\ncampaign that has a lot of different\ntypes of creatives and then if you find\ncertain creative is kind of picking up\nsteam doing kind of well then we'll\nseparate that out into a separate\ncampaign and run a brand new campaign on\nthat exact creative and kind of just\nrinse and repeat over and over again\nacross new creatives then run the new\ncampaign yada yada etc. Yeah. No. So\nexactly. So this was originally our test\ncampaign. So if you go into all these\ndifferent adsets, you're going to see\nthat there was three ads that are being\ntested here. And then once I found the\none that was performing the best. And in\nthis scenario, if we just go in here and\nthen we we sort by purchases, you can\nsee all the conversions came from ad\none. So I was like, okay, great. Ad one,\nit's obviously a winning ad creative.\nCPCs are pretty looking pretty good,\ntoo. I'll say anything generally, you\nknow, below 70 cents is pretty good for\nCPCs. Like I wouldn't stress too much\nabout CPMs and CTRs uh because you can\nhave high CPMs and high CTR and then\nstill have a good CPC, right? I'll say\nCPC is the number that you're going to\nwant to care the most about. While you\nknow sometimes in alternative cases,\nyou'll have low CPM, but if your CTR is\nalso very low, your CPC is going to like\nbalance out to be the same number. For\nyou out there that don't know what CPC\nstands for, it stands for cost per\nclick. CTR is the click-through rate.\nhow many people are clicking through to\nyour website for an advertisement. And\nCPN stands for cost per million, which\nmean how much does it cost per thousand\nimpressions. So in this case, we're\npaying $9.32 per thousand impressions on\nthe ad. So, and once I found out that\nadin was the winning creative, like I\nsaid earlier, what I did was that I\nstart putting into a separate campaign.\nSo, I create a new campaign. I call\ninterview prep add 1 CBO. In this case,\nI created like different assets just to\nfind out like if Meta is going to find\ndifferent pockets of audience that are\ngoing to convert well. But I had all the\nsame advertisements because you don't\nwant to give Meta too many options. Even\nthough the Meta algorithm is very\npowerful, you don't want to give it too\nmany options of too many choices of\nlike, oh, we're testing out different\nadsets, you know, different audience\npocketses, while we're also testing out\ndifferent ads, right? You kind of want\nto narrow the choices that Meta has to\nmake so that it can do the best job and\nhelp me optimize your paid ad. So in\nthis case, since I already know this is\na winning ad creative, I'm just going to\nsay I want to test out audience pockets,\naudience pockets, but I don't want to be\ntesting out different ad creatives\nanymore. And then obviously I started\ncreating new CBO campaigns as well. And\nthis kind of like is something that I\nlearned this time that I'm running ads.\nSo the last time I was running ads was\nback in 20122 when I was doing drop\nshipping. And I will say meta ads ads\nhave changed quite a bit since then in\nthat it's a lot more advanced nowadays.\nlike the algorithm has gotten a lot\nbetter cuz back in the day, you know,\n2021 to 2022, there was a lot more about\nlike how you're strategizing your ads\nand the targeting, the interest\ntargeting. Like back then, you were able\nto target users based on their interest,\nright? So, for example, let's say\nThomas, you and I are into\nentrepreneurship. Like, we can literally\ntarget individuals that are into like\nentrepreneurship, they're into software\nengineering, they're into like, I don't\nknow, mugs or something. But in today's\nworld like you can no longer do specific\ninterest targeting on meta ads. Like\nmeta ads has completely abolished that\nand everyone is doing broad targeting\nwhich sounds like a bad thing but the\nreality is that like because the algor\nhas gotten so advanced you don't even\nneed to do interest targeting anymore.\nMeta is pretty good at finding the\npeople that want to purchase your\nproduct for you at this point. So we\nused to do back in the day was we'll\nlaunch a bunch of new campaigns a bunch\nof new CBOS and you know just keep\ntesting testing testing until you find\nsomething that work. But something I\nlearned is that I launched a bunch of\nnew campaigns and all these campaigns\npretty much had the exact same setup,\nright? Targeting the same ads and\neverything. But I I realized that a lot\nof them kind of had similar results in\nterms of like the people that were\npurchasing and people that you know\nended up buying our tools. So something\nI learned is that it's not so much about\nyou knowing and your ad strategy. It's\nmore about your creative and the product\nyou're selling. Right? I'll say ad\nstrategies in 2025 makes marginal\nimprovements rather than it being like\nthe thing that gets you the conversions\nanymore. But that being said, you always\nwant to be testing out different\nbudgets, different regions, you know,\ndifferent adset amounts and you know,\ntest even like day partying might test\nyour ads on different times of the day\nor test your ads on different days of\nthe week. And those are all things that\nI tested out. But truthfully, I think\nmeta ads at this point, it's pretty good\nthat if you have a good creative, you\nhave a good product, it doesn't really\nmatter what type of strategy you\nimplement, you're going to get the\nresults very quickly and you're going to\nfind out if what you have is working or\nnot working. If I was to go back in time\nand redo this again, I will still have\nan initial testing campaign where I'm\ntesting out different ad creatives, but\nafter that, I'll throw into a new CBO,\nlet it run, maybe test it out once\nagain. But if that still doesn't work,\nit probably means that it didn't work,\nright? But over here, I I kept on\ntesting again. Yeah, test it again. Test\nit again. Test it again. Thinking that\nthings will change. But the reality is\nthat like even though we did get\nmarginally better results over time, it\nwasn't anything like, oh my god, like we\nhad something that all just like\nexploded. It all kind of bounced out to\nbe the same result. Makes sense. Makes\nsense. Yeah. Like we were kind of doing\nthe same thing hoping for a drastically\ndifferent result, but we were just\ngetting like marginal improvements here\nand there, but nothing like no no like\nthree or 4x improvement. And something I\nwant to bring up is eventually what you\nsaid earlier of like why don't you just\ntest everything under one campaign. I\nstarted doing that like I think I\nwatched like a YouTube video. I was\nwatching this guy. He literally just had\nthree campaigns. He had one testing\ncampaign and then two other campaigns\nwhere he was just scaling ad creatives\nand just like yeah this this should just\nwork. Like you don't need to make it too\nfancy or too complicated. Like you just\nneed three campaigns. One for testing\nand then two others for like scaling\ndifferent ad creatives. And what he also\neventually also said he can you can just\ndo is that you can test and scale ads in\nthe same campaign. And that's what I\nstart doing here. I just start assigning\na single ad to every single adset. So\nover here this adset has ad four. This\nadset right here has ad one. And then I\njust start testing all the same ads in\nthe same campaign. But I would just\nassign a different ad to every single\nadset instead. And just like just let it\nrip here. And if it did well, I was just\ngoing to increase the budget on the\ncampaign level and let Meta like funnel\nmore spend into those specific adsets/\nads. And that's why he said like that's\nwhat he does nowadays and that's how he\nscales like seven figures cuz\ntruthfully, you don't need to do\nanything more fancy. You don't need to\ndo anything crazy. You can literally\ntest and scale adsets and ads in the\nsame campaign now. Awesome. That's about\nit. Thanks so much, Andrew, for coming\nin and explaining our general paid ad\nstrategy setup and everything. Now,\nwe're going to zoom back out and we're\ngonna go over a little bit about some of\nmy thoughts about how paid ads work,\nwhether I liked it or not, maybe some\nthings we could have done better, just\nsome general thoughts about paid ads for\nSAS in general. But yeah, thanks again,\nAndrew, for coming in. Cool. Thanks for\nhaving me. All right, so once again,\nthanks again to my co-founder, Mang\nMangduck, on all the major social media\nplatforms for walking us through how\nexactly the ad campaigns were set up for\nour app, perfectin.ai. But now, I'm\ngoing to head on over back into the ads\nmanager portal and show you some of the\nmetrics that we were seeing. All right,\nso this is our paid ads dashboard within\nMeta. So, as you can see, we run a\ncouple of different campaigns or so, and\nthe total amount of money that we spent\nis\n$2600. And we got over 200,000\nimpressions. Our CPM, our cost per,000\nimpressions is roughly $11. And at the\nend, I think our CTR was actually\nlooking pretty good. We were seeing a\nroughly a 2% CTR across all the\ndifferent campaigns that we were\nrunning. And our cost per click was\nrelatively low as well. It was 58. And\nthen at the very end though, our average\npurchase price is roughly in the $39\nrange. So we offer subscription tiers at\nvarious price. I believe right now it's\n30 bucks a month, 50 bucks for 3 months,\nor 75 bucks for 6 months. So as you can\nsee, people are kind of split between\nthe $30 a month plan versus the $50 for\n3 months plan. That's why the average\npurchase rorowaz know the average\npurchase price is in like $39 $40 range.\nAnd as you can see, our purchase return\non ad spend is 40.47. What this means is\nfor every $1 that you're putting in,\nthat $1 is turning into 047. As you can\nsee, we're losing money. But that's a\nquick overview of our meta ads\ndashboard. Let's quickly zoom out of\nhere, get back to the normal camera\nview, and I'll talk a little bit more\nabout my experience running paid ads and\nanalyzing and breaking down some of\nthese numbers. So, as you can see, paid\nads is theoretically sounds amazing.\nIt's theoretically a money printer, but\nwe had a little bit of difficulty. As\nyou can see, we spent over $2,000 on\npaid ads, but our rorowaz, our return on\nad spend was relatively low. It was only\nlike 04.5. So, what that means is for\nevery dollar we were putting in, we were\nonly getting 50 cents back. So, we were\nlosing money from running paid ads. But\nthat metric is only average purchase\nrorowz. So, that means that's what\nFacebook is tracking in terms of what\nthe user checked out with. But\ntheoretically, since this is a\nsubscription product, there's a chance\nthat, you know, with our customer\nacquisition cost, it was roughly around\nlike the $50 or $60 range.\nTheoretically, if a user continuously\nsubscribes for multiple months on end,\nthat initial $30 purchase that Facebook\ntracked, it could actually extend to a\nmuch bigger revenue down the line. Maybe\nif a user renews or stays for three or\nfour months in the future, that $30\npurchase, that low, relatively low\npurchase rorowaz number, it could\nactually be much higher because the\nlifetime revenue is what's a more\nimportant metric, not just an immediate\npurchase rorowaz number. But I am a\nlittle bit skeptical about whether or\nnot that's actually going to be the case\nwith our product. Because if you think\nabout our product in general,\nperfectin.ai, if the product is\nsuccessful and it actually helps the\nuser land their job, it has churn built\ninto the product. In the best case\nscenario, the user should stop paying\nfor a product, it should help them get a\njob. It's kind of like a dating app. How\ndating apps in the best case scenario.\nIt should be deleted off of your phone\nbecause the relationship should work, no\nlonger have to pay for whatever dating\napp that you're using. But I'm\npersonally a little worried and a little\nscared about continuously running these\npaid ads because we are seeing some\nearly metrics of users churning at a\nsomewhat regular rate. We don't have a\ngreat idea or great number of what\nexactly our customer lifetime value or\ncustomer LTV is quite yet just because\nwe've only been around for a couple\nmonths, 2 3 months at this point. But\npaid ads is expensive and we are losing\na bit of money. Another big lesson I've\nlearned during this paid ads thing is\npaid ads is really, really, really hard.\nAnd it is a similar game to organic\nsocial media, but it is also slightly\ndifferent from organic social media as\nwell. Don't get me wrong, the fact that\nmyself and my co-founder have a pretty\nstrong background with organic social\nmedia, it does give us an edge in terms\nof creating these creatives for paid\nads. But the strategy, the meta does\nfeel a little different. It's like with\norganic social media, you have to kind\nof hook the viewer in to watch your\nvideo a little bit more. Whereas with\npaid ads, by default, you are paying for\nthat view. So you can do a little bit\nmore of product education, product\nselling. you can sell the product a\nlittle harder compared to organic social\nmedia. So, it's a similar game to\norganic social media, but it is a very\ndifferent game as well. Another big\ntakeaway that I have had with paid ads\nis the fact that it is a really, really\nexpensive game. After talking to a\ncouple of other people in the paid ad\nspace who are more experienced in paid\nads than both myself and my co-founder,\nthe big takeaway that we were seeing is\nthat paid ads is a really big testing\ngame. It's almost like you're spending a\nlot of time in the research and\ndevelopment process spinning out like\ntens and hundreds of different creatives\nand testing them a lot. like spending a\nlot of money to test various different\ncreatives and you're going to lose a lot\nof money in this testing period. And\nthen the eventual goal is to find that\none creative that absolutely converts\nlike crazy and it prints money like a\n and then at that point you\njust blow a ton of money into that one\nhighly highly converting creative and\nthat's kind of where the money is at. So\nit's a lot of experimentation in the\nbeginning. you lose a lot of money\ntrying to find the right creative, the\nright messaging, the right targeting.\nAnd then once you find the right setup,\nthen you run that like crazy and blow a\nton of money into it. And that is where\nyou make a lot of the return on\ninvestment with that one winning\ncreative that you found after that giant\ntesting process. Overall, do we plan to\ncontinue running paid ads? The answer is\nno. I kind of alluded to it in this\nvideo, but we do believe that we\nprobably could find a winning paid ad\nstrategy, but at the end of the day,\nwe've been getting pretty good signal\nwith organic social media only, and we\ndon't feel like we're actually gaining\nthat much with paid ads. And actually,\nthe bigger reason that we decided not to\ncontinue running with paid ads is\nbecause we're doing a slight pivot in\nour business. I'm going to make a much\nmore detailed video in the future\nbreaking down more in depth why we're\ndoing this pivot. But essentially with\nthis pivot, we're still going to keep\nour existing Perfect Interview app for\nconsumers to use. But one big shift that\nwe're trying to do is shift over to a\nB2B angle where we actually reach out to\nindividual career coaches and try to\nhave them host their own like career\ncoaching platform, their interview\nprepping platform within Perfect\nInterview AI and they pay us like a flat\nmonthly fee. I don't know, a couple\nhundred bucks a month. And we are\nactually betting on that being a\nsignificantly larger portion of our\nbusiness than the consumer side. So\nbecause we're going down this B2B angle,\nwe are doing a lot more cold outreach,\ncold DMs instead of the paid ads route.\nSo that's actually the bigger reason why\nwe're pausing on paid ads. If we had\ndecided not to do this pivot, this\nslight B2B pivot, there's a good chance\nwe would have continually run these paid\nads and tried to figure out a strategy.\nBut I also do think that in the end,\nperfect interview.ai, it is not the best\ncandidate for a paid ads product. Number\none being, like I said earlier, it's a\nproduct that's supposed to have churn\nbuilt into it. The customer acquisition\ncost that we were seeing of like the 30,\n$40, $50 range is pretty high. And\nessentially at that point you have to\ndecide between trying to figure out how\nto lower the customer acquisition cost\nor on the other hand try to increase the\nLTV of your customer for your product\nthat you're building. I don't quite know\nhow low a customer acquisition cost can\nbe but our product of perfect interview\nthe BTOC angle of it. It just seems like\nthe average purchase price and for now\nwith the early metrics that we're\nseeing, the average lifetime value per\ncustomer is also kind of low where it's\nreally hard to make that equation match\nout to have a higher LTV than higher CAC\nbecause that's the only way that you're\nactually going to make money. So, I just\ndon't know if Perfect Interview is\nnecessarily the best product because\nit's not a super sticky product that a\nuser will continuously pay for and use\nmonth over month. So, then we would have\nto figure out how do we make perfect\ninterview.ai like a $100 or a $200 or a\n$300 a month product. That's pretty\ntricky to do from a consumer side of\nthings and that's why we think we can\nactually make it a$100 to $200 to $300 a\nmonth product on the B2B side of things\nand that's we are pursuing that angle as\nwell. So that is a quick overview about\nmy experience running paid ads on Meta\nto promote my app via paid ads. Let me\nknow if you have any experiences running\npaid ads yourself. I'm definitely not an\nexpert. I definitely messed up a lot.\nI'm not claiming to be an expert at all.\nI'm sure there's a lot more that I could\ndo talk about. But let me know any\ncomments down below your experience\nrunning paid ads. Any feedback, things I\ncould have done better. Let me know. All\nright, that's it for this video.
