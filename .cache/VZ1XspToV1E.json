{"transcript": "If any viewers is watching this and does\na video on YouTube for 45 days, if they\ndon't make at least $5,000, I'll just\nPayPal you $500.\n>> This is Vasco. He built an AI app that\nin just 2 years went from 0 to $70,000 a\nmonth.\n>> Most our users come from YouTube.\n>> But here's what's crazy about his story.\nHe did it all with YouTube. One video a\nday, nothing fancy, no crazy tools, and\nit worked.\n>> The way in which you get people to buy\nfrom you is if they know, like, and\ntrust you. Using a simple strategy,\nVasco turned YouTube videos into a\nmillion-dollar business. And I brought\nhim onto the channel to break it all\ndown. In this video, we'll dive into his\nYouTube strategy that generates $70,000\na month. How you can create money-making\nassets that sell your product while you\nsleep, and why YouTube beats every other\nplatform for building trust and getting\nconversions. All right, this one's going\nto be fun. Let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls,\nand this is Starter Story. All right,\nwelcome Vasco to the channel. Tell me\nabout who you are, what you built, and\nwhat's your story.\n>> Hey, my name is Vasco. I built a\nsoftware company called Arvo. We scaled\nit from zero to around 70K in MR fully\norganic. And I think the most\ninteresting part about this is that we\nleverage just one platform, which was\nYouTube.\n>> Before we get into this YouTube\nplaybook, which I think is amazing. I\nthink people watching this are going to\nlove it. I just want to understand what\nyour product does. What is Arvo? What\ndoes it do? Who are the customers? So,\nArvo helps marketing agencies, business\nowners do SEO a bit faster leveraging\nAI. SEO tends to be a tedious process,\ntakes a lot a lot of time. We try to\nshorten the time until where you can see\nresults. It starts from around $99 a\nmonth. It goes all the way to almost\n$700 a month. We do of course as a SAS\nhave charge. So, along the way, we have\na lot of clients, but at the moment, we\nhave around 600 paying clients.\n>> That's amazing. This business is doing\nbasically a million dollars a year. How\ndo you find the idea for Arvo? How do\nyou get to this point? It was 2016 or\n2015. I was just browsing YouTube and I\ncame across this guy called Alex Becker\nand I saw a video from him where he was\nmaking supposedly 10K a month doing rank\nand rent SEO. And so I started doing\nthat. Bought my first domain, started\ndoing local SEO with rank and rent. Got\na couple of clients then got a bit tired\nof dealing with clients. So I just took\nmy SEO services and started selling them\non Fiverr, Upwork and other\nmarketplaces. But then I noticed that\nthese marketplaces, they were missing a\nlot of things that I wanted to see in my\nown marketplace. And so I built my own\nSEO marketplace called Vetted. We sold\nit last year and the AI bubble was just\ncoming. When I sold Vetted, I knew that\nI wanted to still build something in the\nSEO space, but now applying AI to it.\nAnd so we thought an AI writer could be\na good idea. So we built it. That's\nbasically the whole story of how Argo\ncame about.\n>> Okay. Well, what I'm really excited and\nwhy I really wanted to have you on the\nchannel, Vasco, is what you told me\nabout how you grew this business. I\nthink a lot of people watching might be\nwondering how you built it, what the\nproduct does. I think one of the coolest\nthings about what you did is how you\ngrew this business. So, can you give me\na breakdown of what the main growth\nchannel is for your SAS? Most our users\ncome from YouTube. The way in which you\nget people to buy from you is if they\nknow, like, and trust you, right? And I\nthink the best way to have someone know,\nlike, and trust you is if they see your\nface and they hear your voice for long\nperiods of time. All in all, I think\nYouTube has everything you need to have\nsomeone like, and trust you, and then\nbuy from. It's not to say that Tik Tok\ndoesn't work, blogging doesn't work,\nTwitter, LinkedIn doesn't work. But I\nthink as in terms of a ratio to effort\nto results, I think YouTube is the best\none.\n>> Okay, that's amazing. This business was\ngrown purely with YouTube. But what I\nreally want to get from you, Vasco, is\nthe full playbook. Tell me exactly how\nyou went from zero to a million-dollar\nbusiness purely with YouTube.\n>> So this was basically our playbook in\nthree core steps. First one is you have\nto focus on producing money making\nassets. I just produce a bunch of long\nform content in basically three buckets.\nFirst bucket again is evergreen. So a\nvideo that I know that if I post today,\nit will still keep on getting views a\nyear, two years from now. And we do have\nthose videos. I'll give you an example.\nWe have a video on the best AI SEO\nwriter. The second bucket is news\nrelevant type videos that get a lot of\nviews in the first two or three days and\nthen die out. These are basically a new\nGoogle update comes out. This is good to\nget a bunch of subs and a bunch of new\neyeballs onto your channel which then\nyou can funnel into your products or\nservices. Then the third is just sort of\nviral like Mr. Beast like videos but\napplied to software which is quite hard\nto do. Then we just do that over and\nover again. The issue with that is that\nI'm just one so I'm sort of capped as to\nhow many videos I can do. And so I say\nthis to say that this goes into the\nsecond part of the strategy which was\nhow can I multiply myself? And so what I\ndid then was I created a bunch of\nYouTube channels. Vasco SEO tips, Tim\nSEO guru, SEO news, whatever. I had all\nthese channels we owned. And so then I\nhad to find creators because my goal was\nto have all channels and post a creator\nin each one of those channels. The wrong\nway to go about finding creators is\ngoing and finding creators because\nthey're very expensive and they have a\nbig ego. And so what I did was let me\nfind people who I think can become\ncreators. So I went on Upwork and I\nskimmed through people's profiles who\nfor example had a video. Having a video\non your Upwork profile tells me that\nyou're sort of comfortable in front of\nthe camera. So I went and went after\nthose guys. And so all in all, I had all\nthese channels and I paid people per\nperformance and I paid people per uh per\nvideo. On top of that, why not expand to\nother languages? So we found Portuguese\ncreators, we found Spanish ones just\nlike Mr. Vist does with these channels.\nAfter you've done step one and two, you\nwant to focus on the third step, which\nis scaling and expanding with paid ads.\nMost of your videos graphs will look\nlike this. They go up, get views, and\nthen they stagnate and get no more\nviews. And so what I've noticed was that\nwhen we were getting views, we were\ngetting sales. And then when the views\nstagnated, we stopped getting sales. I\ndidn't felt like recording the same\nvideo over and over again just to get\nthose initial views. And I think that's\nwhere paid ads came in. So on YouTube,\nyou can run what's called infeed ads.\nThese ads appear in um two places. First\none is on on your YouTube homepage. And\nthen when you're watching a video, it\nshows up on the right hand sidebar. So\nthey look like organic pieces of\ncontent. I took the videos who performed\nwell, who got views, got sales, and then\nstagnated and I paid YouTube for infeed\nads. The issue with YouTube and YouTube\nads as well is that it's very hard to\ntrack. To track YouTube organic, what\nwe've done is three things. First one\nagain is have a dedicated UTM in each\nvideo. If maybe 1% of people click the\nlinks in the description, you know that\nthey came from that video. Something\nelse we did to increase the tracking\naccuracy was have a dedicated coupon in\neach video. I would say something like,\n\"Hey guys, if you want to check out\narvogar.com and by the way, if you want\na coupon code, just click the little\nchat bubble at the bottom and ask the\nguys from support saying, \"Hey, Vasco\ntold me I can get a coupon code. I came\nfrom this video. Give me a coupon code.\"\nAnd third thing, if you go on to arbor\nright now, if you sign up, we have like\na welcome questioner where if you select\nyou came from YouTube, a bunch of our\nchannels faces pop up. So, you can\nchoose which creator you came from. When\nI mentioned about scaling with paid ads,\nyou have to be careful because you never\nknow if you're not promoting a video\nthat's not bringing in many sales. Two\nextra tips on CTAs. before I was doing\nthe call to action at the end of the\nvideo and that doesn't make any sense\nbecause most people don't watch all the\nway through. So just the simple fact of\nmoving the CTA towards the beginning and\nthe middle of the video just increased\nour numbers of of signups by by a lot.\nSecond thing is don't just make generic\ncall to actions like uh yeah just go\ncheck out the website. What we've been\ndoing is we create specific call to\nactions. So we make them sort of\ninteractive not just a generic one and\nprompting them to do an action inside of\nthe site. That's it. I think your\nstrategy is really smart. You built this\nawesome tool and then you use YouTube to\ngrow the business. But it still reminds\nme, you can't make YouTube videos about\na product that doesn't exist. If you\nwatching this don't have something built\nyet, all the content strategy in the\nworld won't help you. And this is\nexactly why we launched Starter Story\nBuild. It's our flagship program where\nyou will learn how to build and launch\nyour project using AI coding tools in\njust a couple weeks. You'll get access\nto our build experts. You'll join\nthousands of other builders and you'll\nlearn our complete framework for\nbuilding and shipping apps. Once you\nhave something built, then you can go\nstart creating YouTube videos just like\nBasco did. So, if you're ready to build,\njust head to the first link in the\ndescription to check out Starter Story\nBuild. All right, Vasco, let's get to\nthe next question. I would love if you\ncould actually show me a real example\nfrom your YouTube channels for your\nbusiness. Can you show me a YouTube\nvideo that kind of changed your\nbusiness?\n>> Yeah, sure. I guess this is the very\nfirst one where I realized the power of\nYouTube which again this was posted I\nthink 2 years ago. It's a video on how\nto make a Wikipedia page. It's a very\nbad tutorial but still till this day it\ngets 1.2 million impressions. I think\naround 300 views every single day. 65%\nof traffic comes from YouTube search.\nHow to create a Wikipedia page, how to\nmake a Wikipedia page. 20% of the\ntraffic comes from Google search. Not\nonly does a video rank on YouTube, it\nalso ranks on Google. And I can go on to\nthe LLM type of things because nowadays\nwe see a bunch of our videos being\nrecommended in these LLMs. So if I can\ngive any tips is to yes build out these\nevergreen videos. Granted though it's\nvery important to know that mix up these\nevergreen ones with sharing case\nstudies, sharing news, just produce\nvaluable content and know that there's\nsome chance that those videos can become\nevergreen in the long run.\n>> Okay, thanks for sharing those real\nexamples. My next question for you for\nanyone watching this that wants to do\nthis YouTube thing to build a business\nthrough YouTube content, what would be\nyour advice on how to get started if\nyou're getting started right now in\n2025?\n>> I think as cliche as it sounds, like\nwith anything, you have to be consistent\nand do a lot of volume. I think Alexis\nsaid this, it's very difficult that you\ndo something a lot of times for a long\nperiod of time and you don't see\nsuccess. So for YouTube, what I advise\nis, okay, just post a video every single\nday for 45 days. Most people will watch\nthis and won't do it. The rest of the\npeople will try to do it and will stop\nafter a week. Maybe like one or two\npeople out of all them will actually do\nit. And those who do it will actually\nsee success. If any viewers watching\nthis and does a video on YouTube for 45\ndays, if they don't make at least\n$5,000, I'll just PayPal you $500. By\nthe way, don't think that you need to\nhave these very polished videos, right?\nall our videos that got this from\nliterally zero to 70k MR just myself in\nmy basement recording just a micro board\nlike a whiteboard going over valuable\nstuff. Well, on that note, I think\nthat's cool. You know, starting small,\njust using Loom. What are the tools that\nyou use and would recommend other people\nto use if they want to be recording\nevery day, creating lots of content on\nYouTube.\n>> You don't need much. You need Loom. Get\nthe premium version so you can record in\nHD. You need Myro. That's the whiteboard\nI use. Then you need some sort of way to\nedit the videos. I use Camtasia. I think\nyou should put more work and more effort\ninto the hardware than the software.\nHave a good mic, have a good uh camera,\nand have good lighting. So, a regular\nrunning light or mic. I use this Sure\nSM7B. That's it. Don't over complicate\nit. I think the hardest part is getting\ngoing.\n>> Okay, cool. I mean, that's a nice stack.\nLast question that we have for everyone\nwho comes on starter story. If you could\ngo back in time, stand on young Vasco's\nshoulder when you were just getting\nstarted out or for anyone who's watching\nthis that wants to do what you did,\nbuild a million-dollar SAS, what would\nbe your advice? I think it's very\nimportant to know that this is very\nhard. This is very difficult. The best\npiece of advice I can give you is that\nto increase your chances of succeeding,\nis you have to work very hard. I did 20\nto 30 minute videos every single day for\nalmost a year. Who's willing to do that?\nTo be in the 1%, you have to be willing\nto do what the other 99% of people\naren't willing to do.\n>> There are no shortcuts. I believe that.\nThanks for coming on, Vasco. I love the\nbusiness that you built. Thanks for\nsharing this whole YouTube thing,\nsharing those YouTube videos that you've\ncreated. I think people are going to\nlove this. If you enjoyed this video and\nyou're watching this, let me know if you\nwant to have Vasco back on and we can go\ndeeper into the YouTube playbook. So,\nput a comment down there if you want to\nsee that. We can do it. Otherwise,\nthanks for coming on, Vasco, and we'll\nsee you soon.\n>> Cheers.\n>> All right. I want to thank Vasco again\nfor coming on to the channel. I'm a huge\nfan of YouTube, obviously, and I think\nhis YouTube strategy is genius. So,\ncongrats on the success, Vasco. But I do\nhave to remind you, if you're watching\nthis, that all of this still starts by\nbuilding something. Without a product,\nyou'll have nothing to promote.
