{"transcript": "Today's episode is the bootstrappers\nguide to getting customers with Google\nads, with Facebook ads, with Perplexity,\nwith Hey Gen, with 11 Labs, and more. It\nis easy to vibe code an app. You've done\nit. I've done it. But it is so hard to\nactually get customers. Now, there\ndoesn't exist tutorials on YouTube that\ngive the actual sauce with how to do it.\nAnd today with Cody Schneider, we just\nshow you how to do it step by step. How\nto get your customers, how to run paid\nads. What does that look like? No\ngatekeeping, all the sauce. And if you\nstick to the end of the episode, I think\nthat you're going to be a better\nfounder, a better entrepreneur. And\nthese types of episodes, people, they\ncharge 5, 10, 15, $25,000 for it. This\nis absolutely free. I hope this gets\nyour creative juices flowing and I hope\nthat you build a big business with some\nof these ideas.\n[Music]\n>> Cody Schneider on the pod. We're going\nto talk about how to grow your vibe\ncoded startup. You you built something.\nYou vibecoded something, but you need\ncustomers. And no one's talking about\nthis and no one is explaining to you in\na simple way how to actually do it with\nthe alpha. Um, so I brought in Cody\nSchneider and Cody, by the end of the\nepisode, what are people going to learn?\nI'm going to give you a step-by-step\nplaybook and like the strategy and the\nactual tactics and I'll try to show as\nliterally as much as I can for like each\nof the things whether it's paid ads or\ncold DMs like all the automation tools\nI'm using so that in the next 24 hours\nyou can have some type of marketing\nchannel live to start promoting this\nthing and everything I'm going to teach\nyou layers together right so like it all\ncreates this symbiotic relationship that\ncreates like this growth flywheel for\nyou\n>> let's go all right cool so Let's Let's\nget into it. I know. And you're going to\ngive all the tools, all the talk, all\nthe sauce. I need you to promise me.\n>> I promise you. I'll show you everything.\n>> Okay, cool. All right. So, you can start\nsharing your screen and we'll get into\nit.\n>> Sweet. Okay, cool. So, first off, um\nlet's talk through uh paid ads and what\nlike for most like especially if you're\nbuilding an SMB product like a a B2B\nSAS, but you're like servicing SMBs and\nand maybe we should come up with a\nproduct that we're trying to sell. Uh,\nGreg. Um, this is actually one we're\nbuilding right now. So, I can just use\nthat and I'll share all the the details\nbecause I don't care. Um, but, uh, it's\nbasically a YouTube uh, channel uh,\nemail scraper.\nAnd this is a uh, like perfect type of\nproduct that you'd want to go build. Um,\nlet me do uh, YouTube channel email\nextractor. That's actually what it is.\nBy the way, I noticed I noticed you have\nwhat is that Chrome extension that\nyou're using that shows the\n>> Yeah, it's called Keywords Everywhere.\nThey should they owe me so much money\nfor like showing this. I don't know why\nit doesn't want to open right now, but\nbasically it's just a browser extension\nthat modifies Google so that you can see\nuh the total volume uh the total CP or\nthe average CPC, the competition. Um and\nthen also like this is what I use for\nall those trend graphs that I post. It\nbasically like shows you the search\nvolume over time for this graph. So like\nthis one, there's like not good data, so\nit's doesn't really show anything. Um,\nbut uh this is it. It's a great way to\ndo quick validation research. And for\nanything that you're building, this is\nactually where I would start before I\nwould even build a product is like I\nwould try to figure out like the\nmarketing and the go to market motion\nbefore I even, you know, build anything\nbecause if you can't validate that\npeople actually want to buy this, like\nyou shouldn't build it. And I think this\nis like a mistake I see a lot of\nfirst-time founders or builders create\nor like you know they always what they\ndo is they build product and they try to\nfigure out marketing and it should be\nthe opposite. It should be like validate\npeople want to buy this thing see if you\ncan build it and then figure out how to\nsell it right. Um at its core like when\nyou look at a business you know when\nit's in its simplest form it's basically\nhaving something that people want to buy\nand being able to sell it to them. Like\nthat is a business at its core. And so I\nI think that one of the easiest ways to\nactually validate that this is something\nthat people want to buy is you have to\nyou can just look at like keywords and\nthe keyword volume like are people\nactually searching for this? Can I find\nlike Reddit threads that this is a\nproblem for? Like I would do also this\nlike YouTube channel uh email extractor\nReddit and like see if there's\nconversations around this. It's like\nliterally top result, bro. Like [ __ ]\nrequest for SAS YouTube email scraper.\nCouldn't make that up. You couldn't make\nthat any better, right? Um so anyways,\nonce I found that, um I would be like,\n\"Okay, cool.\" Like now I'm going to go\nbuild a product around this. How would I\nactually market this? Um so I'm going to\ntalk through Google Ads first and the\nactual like setup process. I don't know\nhow much I can show. I mean, I could\nprobably show um I guess we could make\nup like a separate account and like show\nyou I'll just show you the the kind of\nthe the structure that I think that we\ncould do. I actually I'm not sure on\nthis G. So, I'll just kind of play I'll\nplay I'll play jazz on it. Um but so\nanyways, what uh I would then do is I'd\nbe like, \"Okay, cool. I'm going to try\nto set up a campaign.\" The challenge\nwith this is that like you you couldn't\nbid on the keyword phrase YouTube. So,\nwhat you'd have to do is be like channel\nemail extractor, right? And like that\nwould be the ad that you actually end up\nrunning. And uh the uh keyword you would\nbid on is YouTube channel email\nextractor, but you would have to like\nbasically run an ad to uh the the ad\nthat you're like the the ad creative\nthat's in there. It would have to be um\nuh uh like only say channel email\nscraper. And the reason for that is\nbecause like they'll flag this. let's\nactually just like I can just grow and\nset up an account. Um\n>> Sam Alman, the co-founder of OpenAI just\nsaid that it is the era of the idea guy\nand he is not wrong. I think that right\nnow is an incredible time to be building\na startup and if you listen to this\npodcast, chances are you think so too.\nNow I think that you can look at trends\nuh to basically figure out uh what are\nthe startup ideas you should be\nbuilding. So that's exactly why I built\nideabser.com. every single day you're\ngoing to get a free startup idea in your\ninbox and it's all backed by high\nquality data trends. How we do it?\nPeople always ask. We use AI agents to\ngo and search what are people looking\nfor and what are they screaming for in\nterms of products that you should be\nbuilding and then we hand it on a you\nknow silver platter for you to go check\nout. Um we do have a few paid plans that\nyou know take it to the next level. uh\ngive you more ideas, give you more AI\nagents and more almost like a chatgbt\nfor ideas with it, but you can start for\nfree ideabser.com. And if you're\nlistening to this, I highly recommend\nit.\n>> Okay, cool. So, this is uh like a Google\nAds account, and I'm going to show you\nlike step by step how to actually set up\nlike the paid ad strategy here. So, um\nto begin with, you're going to go do new\ncampaign. And what I typically do is I\nstart with a click campaign. And the\nreason for that is because I'm just\ntrying to see the actual keywords that\npeople are searching. All of these\nkeyword research tools. They're going to\ngive you like what they, you know, it's\nan estimate, you know, of of what they\nthink that people are searching based on\nthe data that they're aggregating from\nlike all the clickstream data, etc. But\nwhat I actually want to figure out is\nthe actual search terms that people are\nsearching from the beginning. So, I'm\ngoing to do website traffic. I'm going\nto do search. Another campaign type is\nperformance max. I'll talk about that in\na second. We're seeing that actually be\nreally effective right now. So, I can\ntalk to that in a moment. Um, but then\nwhat I'll do is we'll like throw up a\nwebsite. We'll just say like YouTube\nscraper, right, as like a placeholder.\nUm, and then just to get us to like move\nforward.\nI'm just going to try to pull\ninformation from this, but it doesn't\nexist. So, there won't be anything to do\nthere. Um, so from here, we're just\ngoing to do page view as the event, and\nthen I'm going to talk through how to\nactually set up events uh in the future\nfor the actual signup that you're trying\nto get to happen. You can set up events\nfor signup or also a payment conversion.\nIt's the same exact um uh uh like\ntechnical uh deployment to do both of\nthose things. But again, I'm focusing on\nthe on the clicks to begin with. And the\nreason for that is again I'm just trying\nto understand like the actual like\nthings that people are searching and\nclicking on. It's like a fast way for me\nto get uh initial data. I can always\nchange back to a conversion once I have\nthe conversion um event set up on my\nwebsite. Um but the in the beginning\nwhat you need to do is basically uh just\nlike get data so you can understand how\npeople uh like are trying to actually\nfind this solution. So there's a great\nway to actually test a product too like\nthrow up a landing page in lovable put a\ntally form on it. Send some Google ads\ntraffic to it. I just talked to a\nfounder who's building an app for like\nuh it's like a landing page building\nsoftware. Like I was like this is your\nliteral strategy. Just like bid on this\nkeyword and see if you can get signups\nand like if you can then build the\nthing. Um, so like before you even build\nthe product, right? So anyway, so I'm\ngoing to do clicks and then what I'm\ngoing to do is I'm going to target only\nthe United States and then I'm going to\nupdate for people that are only uh\npresent in that location. You don't want\nto do people that are traveling in that\nlocation. I just see worse results with\nthat sometimes as well. You can see like\nit's this is the the devil in the\ndetails is shown interest in your\nlocation. A lot of people they will get\ntrapped in like um like you'll see this\nwhere the ads will do really well for\nthe first like 14 days and then suddenly\nthey start getting all this cheap\ntraffic from like the Philippines or\nIndia and they're like I don't even know\nhow that's happening. We're not even\nbidding on it. This is a lot of the\ntimes the reason that that's happening.\nSo you're trying to have people that are\nin that location physically. They're\nactually like you know pinging that IP\nwhen they're there. We'll do English. Um\nyou know none of we don't have to set up\nany of the like political ad stuff. Um,\nand then from here, we're going to\nactually go and set up the uh actual ad.\nSo, we'll have that be the final um uh\nlanding page. But then what I would do\nis I would go and then start bidding on\nthose keywords uh that are uh related to\nthe product that I'm trying to sell. So,\nI'm going to talk through this uh in a\nsecond, but what I just did there, so if\nI do this keyword like this, that's\ntechnically a broad match keyword. So,\nit what would happen is it's probably\ngoing to go and bid on anything that's\nemail extractor. Whatever the biggest\nkeyword phrase is that's within this\nlike longtail phrase, it's going to like\nbasically level up into that. And I\ndon't want that to happen. I want it to\nonly bid on a fan like the family of\nkeywords that are related uh to the um\nuh like to that keyword phrase. So,\nYouTube channel email extractor when I\nput those quotations around that uh\nthat's what I is called a phrase match\nsearch. Um, and I I typically start with\nphrase match and then I'll go uh either\ndo a negative keyword uh uh uh\nelimination like if I don't want certain\nphrases to show up within uh the phrase\nmatch or I will do a uh um I will do an\nexact match. Exact match isn't actually\nexact match though on Google anymore. Um\nit used to be in the past I could be\nlike anytime somebody searches this\nkeyword show my ad. They now technically\nexpand the audience and it's total\n[ __ ] I hate it. Um but it's\nsomething that you have to deal with.\nUm, and there's ways around it sort of,\nbut it it they don't actually work. So,\nanyways, you have to basically make the\nlanding page have the language that you\nactually want them to convert for. And\nthen when you do the exact match, like\nsay you want them to like only, you\nknow, only show for uh whenever there's\nYouTube channel email extractor, you\nhave to make the landing page have that\nas the H1, that would be the only way\nthat you could kind of like make it\nlearn down into like only bidding on\nthat exact match keyword. But anyway, so\nI'm going to do that broad match. What\nI'm going to go do now too is I'm going\nto use keywords everywhere again and I'm\ngoing to go and expand uh find all of\nthe keywords that people are searching\num that are related to YouTube channel\nuh email extractor. So what I'm doing\nhere is again I just search this and\nthen I can find all the longtail\nkeywords. So I'm just going to click\nthat button and basically what's\nhappening in the background is it's\ngoing to go and scrape all of the other\nkeyword phrases that people are\nsearching along with that the the phrase\nthat I provided as the source phrase.\nUm, we'll see if this wants to actually\nwork. This app can or this Chrome\nextension can be buggy. So, it is is one\nof those one of those things. It's\nprobably a team and like I actually\ndon't know. I need to meet them at some\npoint. But, um, anyway, so how to find\nYouTube channel by email, email address\nextractor. So, what I would be looking\nfor is like all the ones that are\nYouTube. Um, so go down that list. Um,\nso like YouTube channel email address\nfinder, that's a great one, right? So, I\nwould include that in there as well as a\nphrase match and basically add that into\num sorry, let me just actually get this.\nI think it's like loading, so it's\ntechnically not actually a static piece\nof content. It's like actively moving.\nBut anyways, I would pull all of these\nout. Um let me just stop it and I can\nlike actually do this for you. All of\nthese ones that have YouTube, um I would\ntake these I would pull these out um\nthat have the search intent that I'm\nlooking for. So like email extractor for\nYouTube channel, that's a great one as\nwell. Again, I'm putting these in as a\nphrase match. And I would just do like\nprobably 10 of these. That's all you'd\nreally need to get started. So then at\nthat point, once you've have the\nkeywords that you're bidding on, you\nwould then go and you would actually\nhave a quick question on that.\n>> So if if you go back to keyword uh the\nkeyword tool, it I noticed like a lot of\nthe search volume is in the Yeah. 4 30\nto 170 couple hundred. Some people are\ngoing to look at that and they're going\nto be like, \"How is that enough volume?\"\n>> This is literally like apps that have a\n100 search volume a month. I've paid my\nrent for the last 10 years. Like I will\nnever talk about these in public. I will\nnever share what they are.\nThe only reason I'm sharing this one cuz\nit's like whatever. You know, we're\ngoing to give the sauce away to for free\ntoday because I'm feeling I'm feeling\nlike uh I'm feeling like Chris Kringle\nand I want to I want to I want to be\nSanta to you in the middle of summer in\nthis hot July heat, this hot August\nheat. So, the I wouldn't even think\nabout the search volume. What what I\nwould think about is like, are there\npeople that have this pain point that I\ncan get to pay me $29 a month, $49 a\nmonth, $99 a month? And you know, I\nmean, we can just do that math real\nquick, right? Like if you have whatever\nlike say 49 say you have uh 100 people\npaying you 49 a month like that ends up\nbeing $4900 right and like this is a\nmargin business where it's like your\nmargin is going to be like 95%.\nAnd a lot of the times you don't need\ncustomer service. It's just like set up\na crisp chat, let this thing run in the\nbackground and it's just going to like\nit's a little tool. It doesn't really\nbreak. It doesn't it just does this very\nsmall thing. And I think a lot of the\ntimes like this is what I see a lot of\nthese vibe coders they try to make these\nmassive platforms. It's like yo take a\nstep back find one killer feature have\noff payment and email for like password\nreset like that is your first app that\nyou should build. If you can't get that\nto work you shouldn't level up into like\na platform that has this multi-feature\nproduct scope that's super complicated\nand super interactive. It's just it\nstart with the smallest thing. But\nanyway yeah does that answer the\nquestion on that?\n>> Absolutely. I was hoping you were gonna\nsay that.\n>> Yeah, man. It's Dude, the riches are in\nthe niches and like now it's it's easier\nthan ever to build these and you just\nstack them together, right? Like\neverybody wants to be Peter Levels, but\nnobody actually wants to do what Peter\nLevelvels does, which is like [ __ ]\nbuild a hundred different products and\nfive of them actually make money. And\nthat's like the game here, right? It's\nlike you find a bunch of these small\nlike scraper extractor uh like tools,\nright? Like research tools. Dude, there\nis so much money in data extraction\ntools. It's crazy. Like there's huge\ncompanies that all they do is just like\ndata extraction from government\ndocuments and like they get absolutely\npaid like and nobody wants to like they\njust think it's unsexy or like not\ninteresting but this is what people\nactually want. They want this\ninformation. So anyway, okay cool. So\nyou've got the keywords in there. Um now\nyou're going to set up the ad. So this\nis where I was talking about you won't\nbe able to have YouTube in the name. So\nwhat you can potentially do is do like\nsomething like YT. I probably I don't\nthink that would work. I think they\nwould probably still flag it. Um, you're\nnot going to be able to have YouTube in\nthe actual name of the URL that you're\nsending to. So, like don't name it this,\nname it something else. Um, but what\nyou'll do is have it be like, uh, I\nwould probably do something like uh\nchannel email extractor, right? So, like\nstill talk to that specific keyword,\nemail extractor.\nAnd\nthen the reason for this is I'm trying\nto have the the uh uh I'm trying to have\nthe keyword that I'm bidding on, the ad\nthat I'm showing, and then the landing\npage that I'm sending them to all have\nthe same keyword phrase um throughout\nthe whole funnel. And the and the\npurpose is because you see a higher\nconversion rate when you do this, right?\nUm the the strategy here in the\nbeginning is like I'm just going to bid\non everything. That's why I'm doing\nthose the click campaign rather than\nconversion campaign. And then once I\nstart to see, okay, cool. Like I'm\nseeing a lot of click volume like more\nclick volume than I thought for email\nextractor from YouTube channel than\nYouTube channel email extractor. I'm\ngoing to go and build landing pages for\neach of these keywords. And when I say a\nlanding page, like literally all I'm\ntalking about is like, you know, it's\nit's straight up just like the hero\nsection of your website has that exact\nkeyword. So like an example of this, I\nmean, we could do this in lovable right\nnow, right? like build a landing page\nfor this target keyword. Uh\n>> I mean it should have the best practices\nof a landing page which is for example\nuh you probably don't want to have any\nnavbar. You probably want high cra\ncontrast. You probably want juicy\nbuttons you know% all. So\n>> look at people need to look at you know\nbest squeeze pages, best landing pages\nand use that as a reference.\n>> You want them to do one action. I think\nthis is the thing that people always get\n[ __ ] up on is they're like they're\ntrying to like get them to watch a demo\nand also like download this ebook and\nit's like no this person is coming in on\nan ad. I want to only show them one\nthing that is the most high value thing\nthat I can get them to do and you don't\nknow what that is. You don't even know\nlike is it an ebook? Is it a but it's\none thing that you're trying to get\nthem. You can get them deeper into the\nfunnel later on but like just doing that\none thing is going to be the most\neffective. And you made a great point\nGreg of just like follow best practices.\nLike you can literally go to perplexity\nand be like what what should the\nstructure\nof this landing page be\nuh for this keyword, right? And it's\nlike here's the keyword and then it's\njust going to give you the structure and\nyou take that over to lovable and you\nbuild that landing page out, right? Like\nthat's like literally\n>> it's so easy.\n>> It's so easy. Like this used to take me\nagain like I I've been doing this 15\nyears, right? Like this used to take me\nweeks, Greg. And now I just did this\nlive on a video call with you. Like it's\nthe most insane thing ever. I geek out\nabout this because it is actually so\ncrazy. I'm also realizing we're going\nprobably way like way long on time, too.\nSo maybe we can do the transactional\ntoday and then we can come back and I'll\ndo all the like, you know, the the the\npart two of this later on. So anyways,\n>> um Okay, cool. So you built that landing\npage. Uh we'll let that like just vibe\nin the background while we move forward\non this. And then what you're going to\ndo next is set up this conversion event.\nSo how are you going to do that? You're\ngoing to use Google Tag Manager to set\nthis up. Google Tag Manager is basically\na container that allows for you to\ndeploy uh both scripts um which are\nscripts and pixels are interchangeable\nuh in their in their u in their voice.\nUm but then uh what it allows for you to\ndo as well is you can actually set up uh\nevents that basically wait they set up a\nlistener for an event that gets pushed\nto the data layer so that you can then\nhave a trigger so that when that action\nhappens by the user I can send that\ninformation back to Google ads. And the\nreason that you're doing all of this is\nyou're basically uh trying to say hey\nGoogle you know when people search this\nkeyword there's a cohort that will\nactually make the action that I want\nthem to do. I want them to do this\naction which is a sign up or a payment.\nSo optimize the ad basically of the\npeople that are searching that keyword\nfor the cohort of people that are most\nlikely to do that action. And it's so\nsmart that it can actually like train\nitself into understanding these people\nare most likely to sign up. These people\nare most likely to, you know, actually\nturn into a paid conversion, etc. Um,\nokay. So this is what an actual like\nGoogle Tag Manager account looks like.\nThis is some random project that I've\nbeen working on that's just in the\nbackground. Right. So, how you actually\nset these up um is you're going to go\nand create uh so what you'll search on\nperplexity is like write um event code\nuh for Google tag manager\nuh for uh signup conversion.\nAnd so what this is going to do is\nbasically write the code which is just a\nJavaScript code that you want to fire\nwhen the user does the action that\nyou're looking for. Um so this is like\nwhen they do that form submission. I\nwant this code to fire and it's going to\nsend this event to the data layer. And\nthe data layer is basically just like\nthis like observable place that like we\ncan see information. So, it's going to\npush this code sign up success\nand I can literally go into, you know,\nmy vibe code and be like add this add\nthis event for when somebody completes\nthe form submission and it adds that\nthere right whatever that end you know\nyou can it's super easy to implement\nthis now this used to take again like I\nwould spend two hours with an engineer\nto get this deployed you can now do it\nin like minutes um and then once I have\nthat what I can do is I can set up a uh\nevent trigger within in Google Tag\nManager that actually allows for me to\nobserve that uh uh that event firing. So\nlet me show you what I mean by that. I\ncan go trigger new and then I will\nselect uh custom event and then within\ncustom events I'm going to paste that\nsignup success and we'll just name that\nsomething like um you know event uh\nsignup. And then once I've once I've set\nthat up and I have this code firing at\nthe data layer level, I now can observe\nthat I can actually see that and that\ntrigger I is listening for anytime that\nevent gets submitted. And once that\nevent is submitted, I can then send that\ndata back to Google ads. So I can say\nokay and what I'm doing here is I'm now\nmaking a new tag. So to just take a step\nback to what I've done is I've deployed\nthis Google tag manager code on my\nwebsite. So I've added this to the head\nof the website and the body of the\nwebsite all over the the entire website\nso that I can send all like basically\nall this like data and information and\ntracking back to it. And then I'm set up\nthat trigger that is listening for that\nevent. And then I also have this event\nthat's firing now from within the\napplication pushing that information to\nthe data layer. And once I have all of\nthis set up, I can now deploy something\nlike, okay, I'm going to say this signup\nevent, I want Google Ads, I want you to\nuh do conversion tracking for when\nsomebody completes that sign up. So\nwithin Google Ads, what I can then go\ndo, let me exit out of this. I'll go to\nconversions.\nI can create a conversion for that event\ncalled sign up. And we'll try to\nactually do this live. I don't know like\nwhat it's going to allow me to because\nthis is like an old account. Um,\nset conversions on the website. Get rid\nof that.\nYeah, it's going to force me to have an\nactual website. If you just go in\nYouTube like how to connect uh Google\nTag Manager\nuh connect Google Tag Manager\nto Google Ads.\num Analytics Mania, um Loves Data, and\nthen Measure School are the two the\nthree best on this. They they do great\ncontent. If you do any of those, like\nthis one probably would give you the\nexact like walkthrough on how to do this\nthis conversion linker. Um but this will\nhave the tutorial on how to set this up.\nBasically, what it ends up happening is\nI can set up this conversion ad. And\nwhat's what ends up uh looking what this\nends up looking like is I can have an\nevent that fires\nthat data gets sent back to Google ads\nand then within Google ads I can\nactually see the exact keyword that is\nmaking signups and then I can see the\ncost for the exact keyword that is\nmaking signups. And this is what always\nkills me with indie hackers. It drives\nme [ __ ] insane is they are like oh\nwe're anti-paid ads. I'm like my god.\nLike if you had an ATM where you put a\ndollar in and $4 came out, what would\nyou do? What is their answer? It's like,\nwell, I would put as much money into the\nATM as I could. That is all ads are when\nyou set it up, right? It's like that is\nliterally the game here. And maybe if\nthis doesn't work for your industry\nbecause it's too competitive, like for\nlawyers, right? If you do like truck\naccident lawyer, you know, Dallas,\nright?\n>> Yeah. Impossible, right? Like literally\nimpossible. Like $13 per CPC, like\nyou're going to be you're playing big.\nyou're playing you're playing pro ball\nat that point. If you're bidding on some\nlike little ass tool or something like\nthat, like you can make this work. You\ncan totally 100% make this work. Man, it\ndrives me absolutely crazy that they\nlike say that this doesn't work. It it\nit 100% can work. Like if if search if\norganic search is working for you, paid\nsearch will work for you. I guarantee\nit. Most like nine out of 10 times like\nvery rarely 99 out of a 100red times it\nwill work. very rarely does it not work.\nIt's it's a it's a skill issue. It's not\nthat you're actually like like it's not\na channel that's going to function for\nyou.\n>> Why do they say that? Is it a badge of\nhonor to not do paid ads? Is that why\nthey say that?\n>> I think that's a part of it. I think\nit's also like ego and they think like\nproduct should distribute itself and\nlike all this. And I'm like, dude, like\nif you're getting organic traction\nnaturally on YouTube, why wouldn't you\ngo and pay more creators to make videos\njust like the ones that are getting\norganic traction? Like it's it's so\nfunny to me like you talk to startup\nfounders and I I would see this when I\nwas in the valley where they're like,\n\"Yeah, like we're growing entirely\norganically like 3% compounding month\nover month.\" And I'm like, \"Cool.\" Like\nh what is actually happening? All right,\nyou're getting talked about in Facebook\ngroups to a cohort of people. So, let's\njust turn on ads and see what happens. 7\ndays later, they have triple the leads\nthat they like had ever before. And\nthey're like, \"Yeah, like our our\ninvestors are like, \"Go blow the seed\nmoney as fast as you can.\" And I'm like,\n\"Yeah, I know.\" Like, \"This is this is\nlike I I I think they just like they\nthey don't think in the economics of\nthis.\" And the economics are very\nsimple. It's like I pay a dollar and\nthen that turns into $5 a customer\nlifetime value. But let's actually break\ndown what that means, right? So when I\nput a dollar in or say, let's say I\nspend $100, right? And my cost per new\ncustomer is $80. So that I spend $100, I\nget one new customer that cost me $80.\nAnd this is like actual data. This is\nfrom a company that I ran previously\nthat was like a SMB this this tile,\nright? So the average customer life or\nthe average revenue per customer was\n$39. So I was technically losing money\non getting that customer. I would pay\n$80 to make $39, but the customer\nlifetime value of that person was about\n$550. So I'm paying $80 to make $550 in\ncustomer lifetime value. So when these\nabsolute just like chuds are like, \"Oh,\nit doesn't work.\" Like the roaz doesn't\nmake sense. It's like, \"No, it's a skill\nissue.\" Look at the math. Like what is\nyour average customer lifetime value if\nthey're staying for 6 months and paying\nyou $100, right? That means that you're\nmaking $600 per person. Okay? So, you\ncan afford to pay literally probably\nlike $150 to $200 to get that customer\nand you're going to still make enough\nmoney and make this make sense, but\nthey're like, \"No, I want to like stay\ncore and do this.\" It just doesn't make\nany sense to me. But again, it's just\ndifferent ways to run businesses. I It's\nnot the way that I would run it. I I\nwould I would I would layer all of this.\nI would do paid ads. I would do organic.\nI would do all of these things. But\nthat's just, you know, two different\nways to approach this. So, anyway,\nthat's my tirade. Thank you for coming.\nUm, let's get back to the actual\nscheduled programming. The, uh, so I've\nset up that conversion event now. And\nthat conversion event is, uh, I would do\nthat for a signup and I would do it for\npaid. So, you're probably asking now,\nwhy wouldn't you just go immediately to\npayment? Well, let me tell you, why did\nwe start at clicks and then we work down\nto signups and then we work down to\npaid? It's because I need enough\nconversion actions to actually have\nenough data to be able to make smart\ndecisions. So I start at clicks because\nif I start with an immediately with\nsignups, I'm not going to have enough\ndata to understand like what are the\nlanding pages I should build that are\nmost likely to make signups. So once I\nhave enough signups, um then I can like\nunderstand, okay, cool. Like I another\nway to think about this is like if I\njust turn on ads straight to payment,\nI'm going to have so uh uh not enough\nconversion events for it to train into\nthat payment action. And so I have to\nfocus on the the thing that's more\nupfunnel and train it into that because\nthat is a leading indicator for this\nlike you know this more deeper funnel\naction. And so it's it's basically like\nif you have enough money though you can\ngo day one right? If you have 100 grand\nlike you're going to go straight to\nconversion turn that [ __ ] on and within\nseven days like you're going to be\noptimized into it. But it just depends\non like the the resources that you have\nthe money that's available. For most\npeople that are bootstrapping or like\nsetting up, you know, they're\nself-funding it, they're starting with a\nsmaller budget. And so that's why I\nsuggest the signup conversion to start\nwith. Once you have enough payment\nconversion events though, you can always\nswap that. You can say, \"Hey, I want you\nto optimize for the payment conversion.\"\nUm, and Google Ads actually allows for\nthis. You can set the the value of the\nconversion to be different uh numbers.\nSo I can say, \"Hey, the signup's worth a\ndollar and the payment is worth $10 or\n$20.\" And so then it will start to have\nthat dollar amount that's uh uh attached\nto the user action and will optimize for\nthat dollar amount like basically like\nhow like whatever budget you give it, it\nwill optimize itself into creating the\nmost like ROI from the dollar amount\nthat you've designated each of those\nconversions. So that's Google Ads in a\nnutshell. Very high level. There's way\nmore tactical stuff you could go into,\nbut like I you know we don't have time\nfor a master class. like we could do it\none day, but like if you just do that,\nlike it's it's going to work. Like\nyou're going to get you're going to get\nsomething at least to start happening\nlike some some new DNA entering the the\nthe ecosystem that that you're you're\nsiloed in after you built this app that\nnobody is like signing up for. Um\n>> Peter Levels is silently silently\nshaking his fist right now. I\n>> whatever, man. Like I I you know how I\nfeel.\n>> We all do. We all do. Okay. Anyways,\n>> is there do we have time to go over, you\nknow,\n>> do Facebook ads real quick because it's\nvery related to this? Um, and just like\nrun through kind of the whole strategy.\nUm, and I think that that's probably a\ngood like stop point. Then we can come\nback and we can do we can turn this into\na series where like we'll do a series on\ncold DM and cold email. Those can be\npaired and then we can do the next piece\nwhich is like, okay, here's how to make\na content engine for your business,\nright?\n>> Comment if you want to see that.\n>> If you want to see that, you better\ncomment. I swear to God, you better run\nup Greg's comments right now. I will\nrespond to every comment that says, \"Let\nme like, \"Show me the money. Show me the\ngoods. Show me the sauce.\" I will go\nthrough every single one of them. I want\na thousand comments in the comment\nsection. All right. Okay. So, Facebook\nads um very different in how you're like\nstructuring uh the campaigns and also\nlike the the philosophical kind of like\nthe the framework behind it. So search\nads when somebody searches a search ad\nso when they search this keyword phrase\num YouTube channel email extractor\nthey're signaling exactly what they're\nlooking for they are looking for YouTube\nchannel email extractor right um so you\nhave the search intent built into the uh\nlike you understand what what you you\nneed to show them to create the outcome\nthat you're looking for like you you\nthey're they're they're giving you that\nsearch intent. Paid ads is different. Um\nthe reason for that is because you're\nactually disrupting them. So this person\nis actively in a mindset right now.\nThey're like, \"Okay, I'm looking for\nthis thing.\" So if I get in front of\nthem and give them that thing, they're\nalready in that mindset. Paid ads is\ndifferent. I have to disrupt what\nthey're doing. I have to get their\nattention and then I have to like tell a\nstory that gets them into the mindset\nwhere they're malleable that I can\npresent a new solution that gets like\nthat convinces them to basically buy a\nthing. This is why like you see all this\nlike [ __ ] on YouTube where they're\nlike, \"Sudy psychology, bro. like you're\ngoing to become like the best drop\nshipper ever. And it's like [ __ ]\nman. It's like very simple. It's like\ntalk about people's pain points, cast a\nvision of a future that they can\npotentially have, and then your product\nis the bridge to get them to the future.\nOkay? You just do those things. Like\nyou're you're top 1% of ads. Like that's\nall that's all everything is. You want\nto want an argument like you want to you\nwant to convince the world to not go to\nwar or go to war. like that is the angle\nto do this. You might have to beep that\nout, Greg. I apologize. Um, but the the\nthe it's just storytelling. That's all\nyou're trying to do here. And it's very\nit's way less transactional than the\npaid search side. You have to think\nabout that that component. So, let's\nactually do this. Let's do this process.\nSo, I would go and I'd look like we'll\ngo back to Perplexity and I'd be like,\nuh, give me pain points around uh, you\nknow, YouTube channel, email extractor,\nReddit. And I just be like, \"Okay, like\nhow are people talking about it? What\nare the pain points with this?\" Like,\num, technical barriers users face issues\nwith YouTube recapture. Awesome. This is\nsweet. Okay, cool. I got like a specific\nthing I can talk to. API and scraper\nlimitations. They're limited by API\nrequests. Ethical and legal risk. Okay,\ncool. We don't care about that. We're\nliving in the gray area in our life. Um,\nthe scam and security risks. Uh, this is\nI mean that's just pulling from Reddit.\nSo, this is a pretty simple product. So\nlike technical barriers looks like the\nmain thing that you're solving. It's\npretty simple. What this will probably\nbe probably be um it would be like uh\nyou know the ad that I would probably\nwrite is like if you do create if you do\ninfluencer marketing marketing listen to\nthis like that's the hook and like let's\nactually write this out. Let's write\nthis out like step by step. Um\nso if you do influencer marketing\nlisten to this.\nBy the way, there's only like a hundred\nhooks that exist.\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> For in short form video.\n>> Yeah,\n>> absolutely. SAS, it's even smaller. I\nwould say there's probably like 25 good\nones and like maybe 50 that sometimes\nwork, you know, but like\n>> it's all the same. But this is really\neasy. It's like call out a thing that\nsomebody does and then present the\npainoint. If you do influencer\nmarketing, listen to this. Finding\nYouTube creator\nemails is\nuh a huge pain or sorry takes you know\nwe'll just say like takes hours finding\nYouTube actually let's let's do this\nfind is this like a video that you're\nyou're writing the script for\n>> yeah this is a video this is an AI\navatar video and the reason I'm\nsuggesting this is because AI avatar\nvideos we see those perform best for SAS\nright now those in comics for some\nreason I'm obsessed with the comics ones\nlike four panel comics where it's like\nyou're like telling a little story but\nit looks like native content so people\nare like oh this is just a meme and then\nthey're like [ __ ] it's an ad they're now\nin a funnel it's amazing it works so\nwell I love it it's so so good uh before\nand after comics work really well too\nlike here's where you are here's where\nyou can be if you do this thing dude\nthey just rip anyways but all right so\nfind me quotes about uh like technical\nbarriers\nsee what it says and I'm looking for\nactual quotes of people saying this like\nI worked on comparable prime extract the\nchallenge so bypass the recapture so\nbypass the recapture perfect right\nthere's a limit so we're going to say uh\nfinding or uh getting uh YouTube creator\nemails\n>> couldn't you say\n>> super hard because it bypassing the\nrecapture\nyou know sorry go ahead\n>> I was going to say like to take this\neven a step further, instead of saying\nget YouTube creator email super hard\nbecause by c bypassing the re the\nrecapture and provide me what like\nmaking it more personal and being like\nuh I almost blew my brains out\nafter trying to get a thousand YouTube\ncreators emails because of bypassing the\nrecapture or something like that. Maybe\nnot blow your brains out but something\nlike visual, right? I almost\n>> I wanted to unlife myself because I had\nto get emails behind recaptures and\nbuild like 10 Google accounts to get a\n100 emails. I have done this manually in\nthe past. It's terrible. Don't ever do\nthis. Please, I beg you. But yes,\ntalking exactly to that painoint like\nspeaking to that. That's all we're\ntrying to do here. And like what I'm\ngoing to be able to do live is going to\nbe way shittier than what I would\nactually be able to do if we like sat\ndown and did this. Um but I mean let's\njust take yours. I think that's actually\nlike it's a better ad. So, like um like\nif you're an influencer marketer or uh\nif you do influencer marketing listening\nto this um uh like\nwhat what did you say, Greg?\n>> I mean, I said blow blow my brains out,\nbut that's a bit too extreme. So, maybe\nlike\n>> I don't know what's what's a bit more\nOkay, we can just for the sake of this.\nI want to blow I want like uh Yeah, I\nwant to blow my brains.\nI want to blow my brains out trying to\nget to get YouTube influencer or YouTube\ncreator emails\nbecause the capture\nbecause the capture\nuh because the capture is hard to bypass\nand I told my friend this\nuh\nfriend this who's a a little bit shady,\nwho does a little bit shady internet\nmarketing. Um,\nand uh he told me I should uh I should\nuh uh I should check out this tool\ncalled X\num X does Y thing.\nSo like X uh X scrapes\nYouTube channel emails\num at scale.\nYou just give it a list and it returns\nthe emails.\nIt bypasses the capture for you and it's\nuh saved me from my hemorrhoids\nand\nshitty joke.\nAnyways, um so like I've got this ad and\nnow I what I wouldn't even I I don't\neven know if I'd mention the ad name as\nwell. Like I found that like sometimes\njust like calling it the app I like like\ncheck out this tool this this uh tool\nthat scrapes emails scrapes emails. Um,\nI upload\na list of YouTube channels\nURLs\nand it returns the emails\nby bypassing the capture,\nyou know, for me,\nwhatever, right? And then like uh click\nthe link like click the link to learn\nmore. like don't you don't even like say\nthe app because then it like creates\nlike this like well I want to know what\nthis is now right and then like you'll\njust see like sometimes you'll see\nhigher CTR and all of this is anecdotal\nthis is not have data so like this is\nanecdotal data to support this every\nindustry is different take everything\nI'm saying with a grain of salt but this\nis like a it it something in this\nvicinity will work okay so I take that\nand then I would go and I would go to\nhey Jen and I would use an 11 labs voice\nI don't know if I want to give away this\nsauce but I'm do it cuz again I'm\nfeeling generous today. Natasha Valley\nGirl on 11 Labs absolutely crushes it.\nThe voice is unbelievable. It It is so\ngood. It is so good. So you do that and\nthen the avatar you just like honestly\nhot girls work the best. So that's like\nwhat I would suggest you do UGC.\nUm and like these are ripping right now\nwhen it's kind of this like podcast\nstyle.\num or like car ones where it's like\ncasual. Again, use something like this.\nI like test all of them honestly. Um but\nthen you'd go in, you select one of\nthese. We'll just do her to begin with\nfor No, I don't want it. Oh [ __ ] they\nchanged everything. H\nthey suck. All right, I'm going to\nchange it from Izzy. I want my voices\nNatasha Valley girl. Baby, marry me. Um,\nso then I would go and I you listen\nthrough this and you would generate that\nvideo, download it, and then at that\npoint you take it into like cap cut or\nto script and you're going to remove the\nsilence so that it has like fast pacing,\nadd captions, and then for like the hook\nsection, you want to add uh like a title\num that is at the top of it. And you\nmight be able to do this in here now.\nActually, hold on. Let me let me just do\nthis little like add these. Oh [ __ ] All\nright. Um I'll change this\nthe white or whatever. I don't know. You\nknow, some something that makes sense.\nUm you're trying to make it look as\nplatform native as possible. So that's\nthe thing to remember with this. And\nthen I would add text. Let's add a\ntitle. I don't know if it's going to\nallow you to do this, but you do\nbasically the title would you'd have it\nwant to appear just for that section.\nSo, actually, I'm gonna just\nI don't know how good this is. This is\nlike literally I think they launched\nthis today, which is crazy because I was\njust in here this morning and it didn't\nhave this. So, um\n>> yeah, but anyways,\n>> they just launched this today like a few\n>> interesting interesting. Um but anyway,\nso what you're doing there basically is\nyou are building out this ad within the\napplication. Um you're we're going to\nrun through this. So, uh you have a\ngenerate the avatar. You then shorten\nthe word gaps so that it's like faster\npacing. Um, add captions, add a title\nthat's like some type of hookie title.\nUm, where it's like influencer marketing\neasy mode, right? Or some I don't know,\nwhatever. Test a bunch of different\nones. Um, and have that be for the hook\nsection of the of the ad. And then you\ngo make 10 different variations of that.\nSo, you're going to take this ad and I\nwould go to Claude because Claude's got\nthe vibes. He's just I mean Clode. Is\nthat what you call him? Right.\n>> That's what I call him. Yeah. code.\n>> Nice. Be like be like big dog. Rewrite\nthis\nadd script five times, right? And then\njust look at the variations, the one you\nlike, just kind of reiterate like over\nand over on top of these, right? Um, and\nyou can build like automations for this.\nLike you use like, you know, whatever\nGum Loop or Lindy to like automate this\nwhole process. I would suggest that\nprobably give it good examples of like\nhere's ad structures, hook examples, all\nthat. You can make this way more\nadvanced, but this is the simple\nversion. But once I have that, I then go\nand I do Facebook ads. You're going to\ntarget all of Facebook. So, Facebook has\ngotten so good at understanding the\nperson that's most likely to sign up for\nthis thing that you're trying to\npromote. All that matters is you make\ngood creative now. But how do you make\ngood creative? You test a bunch of\ncreative. So, go test 40 different ads a\nmonth. And what you're going to find is\nlike two to three of those are just\ngoing to crush the rest of them. Those\ntwo to three, you're going to do a\nconversion campaign. And so that that\nevent that we just set up for uh within\nGoogle Tag Manager, I can use that same\nevent, but I can do that event as a HTML\ncustom conversion. So I would deploy the\nthe Facebook ads pixel and then I would\ndeploy the custom event for that signup\nconversion. So let me show you what that\nactually looks like. We'll say write a\nFacebook ad event for signup. It's going\nto like write this create write this\nscript. Um, and so like this script\nright here is all you need. And what\nthat's basically doing is it's sending a\nevent back to Facebook for when that\nuser action is occurring. So our user\naction is the signup event. We're now\nsending that back to Facebook so that I\ncan track that user action. And you can\ndo this also for like if there you want\nthem to schedule a demo or stuff, you\nknow, whatever. You can do this for, you\nknow, kind of any any user action that\nyou want within the application. Um, but\nthen all you're doing is you're\nbasically testing all this ad creative,\nletting them compete against each other,\nand then when you find a winner, all the\nbudget goes there. But what you'll see\nis that that ad will get what's called\nad fatigue. So if a person sees an ad\ntoo much, you know, when you watch TV,\nGreg, and you're like, I've seen this\n[ __ ] Doritos commercial, you know, 20\ntimes, man. Like I I just tune it out.\nSo people do that with, you know, social\nmedia ads as well. And so the strategy\nhere is you're constantly refreshing the\nads so that it set that none of them go\nstale and you take the winners and you\nremix those over and over again. You\nchange hook variations, but maybe you\nfind these pain points work. You just\nlook for the common threads for like\nwhat's most successful. That's it, man.\nThat's paid ads for SAS. That is the\nthat is like the vibe code thing that we\ncould go into details on like how to\nactually track this. Um you can get all\nof this data into like a a data\nanalytics platform like Looker Studio is\noften what's used. It's a pain in the\nass to learn. Or you can use my app.\nThis is the shill. You just sat here for\nan hour. So, we're now going to shill\nit. Uh you can use graph.com. It'll\noneshot dashboards for you. You don't\nhave to learn how to use the tool. I can\nsay, you know, show me clicks week overw\nweek for my Facebook ads and it goes and\nbuilds that. Does that for Google ads,\ndoes that for my Google Analytics, etc.\nUh, go sign up for free. It's a free\n14-day trial. Um, and yeah, that's it,\nman. Any questions I can try to answer\nbefore you cut me off and get me out of\nhere? Cut me loose, Greg.\n>> Uh, thank you, Cody. I want to give one\nquick little little piece of sauce I'm\nsure you know about, but I'm not sure\neveryone knows about or maybe you don't\nknow about this one. So, did you know on\nInstagram you you can do trial reels?\nHave you heard about this?\n>> Yes, I have heard about this. I've never\nran them. I heard they can uh they like\nrip though because it like tests it to a\nhuge wide audience for free, right?\n>> Yeah. So basically if you go and create\nlike as as you're saying basically go\nand create 10 15 20 different pieces of\ncreative\nuh and you can I think you might need to\nbe a creator account or professional\naccount on Instagram but there's a\nsetting in there that says enable trial\nreels. Enable that trial reels thing and\nthen upload\nuh one one of your videos which is a\nreal. Yeah, exactly. Um, and it'll\nliterally\nshare the reel with nonfollowers\nfor free. So, you can see if it's gonna\nresonate with people.\n>> So, it's basically it turns it into Tik\nTok mode and they're giving you this for\nfree. So, some degenerate out there,\nlisten to me. All right? You're going to\ngo make like a hundred uh Instagram\naccounts, okay? And you're going to\ntrial reels all of the hundred Instagram\naccounts. you're never going to actually\npost anything on any of these things,\nright? And that's a way for you to go\nget free reach at scale probably.\nThere's something in there that you can\nprobably game. But anyway, gee, that\nthat's such a good idea, too, cuz like\nthen you don't have to do any ad spend\non the testing. So, you skip that step,\nright? You get to go right to the\nconversion event rather than having to\ndo like the, you know, the click events\nor, you know, whatever else that you\nneed for the testing. It's a super good\ninsight.\n>> Cody, it was an absolute honor having\nyou on today. Thank you for sharing.\nWe'll include links to follow Cody\nuh and his products. And uh you know,\nhopefully come come on again for another\nlittle tutorial like this.\n>> Whenever you have me back, Poppy, I'm\nstill shocked that you have me here\nafter I robbed you. I mean, it's crazy\nto me. I was down in Miami. I learned\nhis address. We came in. We took the\ngood art. No, I'm just playing. Thank\nyou, G, for hosting me as always, man.\nIt's It's always a pleasure. So\n>> that that's a story for another day.\nThat's a story for another day.\n>> Yeah. Yeah.
