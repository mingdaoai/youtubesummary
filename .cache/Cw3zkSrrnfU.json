{"transcript": "I hear a lot of people say that you can't build a \nprofitable business with Vibe Coding tools. Well,  \nin this video, I speak with the founder of \nPlinq, an app doing more than $400,000 in  \nannual recurring revenue. And it's built using \nLovable. In this video, you're going to learn  \nwhat went into building their MVP, and what are \nthe specific tactics that they used to go from  \nzero to over $400,000 in ARR. Let's jump in. just \nto get started above maybe if you could tell us  \nwhat you've built with lovable and how much money \nyou're making. Perfect. I built like everything.  \nSo from blank the platform with itself from our \nback off system for presentation to to investors  \nlike I do almost to our our landing page. I do \nalmost everything on lovable. So from the start  \nlovable was the only I tested Lovable By 44 and \nanother one. But when I started the project of  \nbuilding blink I test this tree and lovable was \nthe best. So I did in like 45 days I did three  \nversions from the platform and until and from this \nis was in April. So I start the process building  \nthe process in April. So from April until now we \nare almost reaching reaching and half a million  \ndollars in annual recruiting revenue. Amazing. \nAmazing. And and what does Plinq do? What what  \nare people paying for? Yes, Plinq is a background \ncheck system like pretty easy in US like it's  \npretty common. We saw a lot of this type of tools \nbut here in Brazil didn't have yet. only more in  \na corporate level like companies that are trying \nto trying to hire people and etc. And I saw on TV  \nI was watching journal with my my dad and I saw \na reportage that made me sick from a girl that  \nshe was with a boy for one and a half year. Uh he \nstart to be on her and she went to the police. She  \ndid everything correct but the police like, \"Oh, \nwe're too busy to go to her house and ask him to  \nleave. So go there and when she came back home he \nkilled her. He stabbed her in the front of his of  \nher her best friend and she left a lot of audios \nbefore this. And one of the audios she said,  \n\"I didn't know. I didn't know that he had a a big \ntrack record.\" Like he beat his mom, his sister,  \nanother ex-girlfriend. I didn't know. And if I \nknow, I never would have been in a relationship  \nwith him. And I was like, why? We don't know. \nThis is public information, but why? We don't  \nknow. like why in Brazil we don't have a system \nlike uh in US we have the sex offender map things  \nlike that here we don't have like nothing all this \ninformation is public but it's not easier to to  \nfind and I was like oh I need to create something \nand that's that's at at this point I start the  \nprocess of building blink what's your background \nhow did you go from yeah like are you technical  \nbefore like like what's your background and and \nwhat were the challenges is and using lovable to  \nto build this. Mhm. Um I've been working with \ngrowth marketing paid media for the past like  \n13 years since I was 15. I am start inside the \nstartup world. So I work in a lot of products  \nlike taking a product from zero to million users \nand different startups and big tech companies here  \nin Brazil outside in US Europe as well. So I have \na big experience with the marketing distribution.  \nI I know a lot of data so I know how to handle and \nknow what to do all the process with cross data  \nand etc. So I had like the vision. I had like a \nidea how to do it but I didn't know actually like  \nlovable helped me like it was the bridge between \nthis all this knowledge and and the actual product  \nand my co-founder he did the API that we used \nto to catch to catch all all the information  \netc from public record and he did in NHN and we \nhad the same backgrounds like we both came from  \nbro marketing for startups and etc. Sure. Got it. \nGot it. So the you built it where it's lovable,  \nbut then you have a lot of the backend logic in N \nand you connect themable to NAND essentially. Yes.  \nThe whole app work together. Yes. Yes. Because \nhow how does work the process for example we have  \ndifferent public records here and when you get \nthis information you have like a really a really  \nblack route data. we don't have like categories \nand etc. So like we we build everything inside.  \nSo catch this data read it so cloud reads the \nprocess and create a resume about all the process  \nstages and etc. And then comes a PDF with the \ninformation. So you receive her WhatsApp and  \nyou can see inside the platform the PDF with the \ninformation. So all of this it was inside lovable  \nis in gen and a lot of update APIs inside gen. \nGot it. Got it. So was there any challenges with  \nbuilding it in this way that you thought oh I \ndon't know if it's going to be possible or at  \nall or at what point um did any of that come up? \nOh, every day, every day. Because when we start  \nthe process, you saw the errors coming and you \ndon't know like what I did, what is happening,  \nwhat I have to do here. So like it's pretty pretty \nrough and at the start I had like a lot of pain in  \nmy shoulder to cold in for hours and etc because \nI have a lot of friends who are developers. So  \nalways call my friends, hey help me with this and \netc. Because lovable back then in April it was a  \npretty different product and I saw like now now if \nI have to build pink now I would build like in two  \nthree hours and I took four or five days because \nit was a different product. So I had all this  \ncomprehensial of the errors. How can I fix it and \nused a lot of AI and friends to make everything  \nwork and we had a huge problem with the PDF API \nbecause we didn't find a good a good API. It was  \nreally hard and we are like delaying the launch \nfor that. And one day I just told my co-founder,  \nhey you have two days to fix like we have two days \nto find the API. if we don't find it, we're gonna  \nlaunch anyway. And he found in base an API that \nthat worked for for system. So all all this stuff  \nwas, you know, was a a problem that we're facing \nand start to evolve. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. And I  \nguess if it if it weren't for AI coding tools like \nLovable, would have you been able to start at all  \nor what would be what would have you done in that \ncase? Oh, probably I would call some friends that  \nare developers like, \"Hey guys, I have this \nidea. Come work with me and do it.\" Like I  \nthink it would be something like that because I \nhad I started thinking about this like thinking  \njust like I would say last year that I started the \nidea and when I saw this news I was like I have to  \ndo it like I have to do it. Yeah. So my first \nidea was like, hey, I gonna find a friend that  \nmaybe is not doing a lot now and do all the coding \nlike in hard code itself. Yeah. Yeah. And then I'm  \nsure it would have taken much longer to build and \nlike the whole because devs they they always like  \ncomplexity because make their time worth it. So we \nalways like to put a lot and this is a thing that  \num I'm start to get more more famous here in \nthe Dave community and a lot of devs they just  \ndon't understand that blink is not about the \nproduct like our product is easy we have one  \nfeature our product is pretty easy to do it so \nit's not about the product the complexity it's  \nanother thing so when when they face like hey this \ngirl did only this without knowing code they like  \nRight. Right. And that's what I think what's so \nvaluable about these tools is like you can have an  \nidea and it can be simple and then in a week later \nyou can start testing it and seeing if people  \nactually want to buy it and and nothing stopping \nanyone from doing that. Um and if you have product  \nknowledge like you with your background I think \nthat's really helpful as well to how products are  \nbuilt and what's the the right way to structure \nthings and things like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  \nCorrect. I totally totally agree with you like I \nhave of course I have a knowledge about products  \nabout about flows about oh the user come here \ngo there and we have to think about this this  \nand that so it was easy but but but it was not \nlike now of course I have knowledge I have a lot  \nof notes I have like a lot of different things so \nit's easy still easy but it's not that easy but  \nlovable and all these platforms they are going \nto work more and more to develop the product to  \nmake easier to everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Totally. \nAnd and okay, so we talked about building it,  \nbut you know, you could have built it in a week \nand that or two whatever and then never gotten  \nanyone to pay for it. So, how did you get $500,000 \nof recurring revenue for this product? What was  \nwhat were the things that that you did to make \nthat happen? Uh the the best part of this that  \nme me and my co-founder and we are like marketing \nexperts. So we did this for a lot of different  \nproducts. My my co-founder he worked for a company \nhere in Brazil who has like um I think per year  \nthey do like 100 million in sales in B2C apps. \nSo like we have a great experience with that.  \nAnd since in the beginning like we know we always \nknew that it was going to be a hit. So like we  \nlaunch it in day 30 31 30 30 30 of May and two of \nJune like two days after we just became viral on  \nlinking with one post this one post was like 500 \nmillion views in two days. So it's like a little  \nbreath, a little talk over there and another in \nthis day like in our 3 days after lunch we got  \nlike 1.5 uh gay new users in one day. So we we \nstop we started like three days without sleeping  \nbecause people started using freaking telling \neverybody and etc. So we always we we always  \nknew that that was going to be a hit and from \nthat we started to test different things. Tik Tok  \npaid media influencers etc. So we did partnership \nwith really huge influencers inside or inside our  \nmission etc. So from that like we we always knew \nbecause of because it's a real problem like it's  \na real painful problem people just need to know \nit like can never work with a product that people  \njust need to know it. Yeah it's an interesting \npoint. It's like if you have a product that solves  \na real problem, then yeah, you still have to do \nall the work of finding influencers or doing the  \npaid marketing, but it's not it's never going to \nwork if people don't want it in the first place.  \nIt's not a solution people want. Yeah. Yeah. This \nis the main this is the main point. Like there's  \nno one who see, oh, this is bad. Oh, I don't know \nif people will want this. like everyone from the  \nfirst first time time that I start to talk with \nmy friends, they're like, \"Oh my god, you're going  \nto be a billionaire because we we knew that that \nwas like a real problem.\" And so from the start,  \nwe know and they start to sell and test different \nthings. Now we bet a lot on Tik Tok. So for  \nexample, last week we did 3 million views only \non Tik Tok. So we do all the now we have like a  \nfull full structure. So in the beginning was only \nme and my co-founder and now we are a team of six  \nand agency and like a lot of things to make all \nall this happen. Yeah. And is this so is this  \nlike a very unique product in Brazil or even in \nthe US? I haven't heard of a product like this.  \nMaybe it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but \nis this something that um could go to other  \ncountries or is it mainly Brazil where the you \nsee the most opportunity based on competition or  \nanything like that? No, I think uh the sad part \nand this is a problem like around the world and  \nI really think that we could be international in \nlike a month if we wanted but now and I want yes  \nI want to be international. We're going to maybe \nstart to Latin America or India like I received  \na proposal to open on India. India and Brazil \nare pretty similar because like we use WhatsApp  \nwe have like India a lot of people. So we and they \nhave a lot of problems with sexual crimes and etc.  \nSo this is pretty similar and I really see this \nfor our future. But now our next app will become  \na mobile app because I want to build the full \ncircle from security to woman. So we go beyond to  \nwe go beyond to background check, we go to social \ncheck, we stay in background check. We have a lot  \nof different tools inside the app who make uh data \neasier, who make like share localization like hey  \nimagine like life 360 but inside bling. So in your \napp we going to be we're going to have like the  \nfull circle from security for woman. So this is \nour next step right now and from that we totally  \nstart to get internal internalization process. \nGot it. Got it. And I think that's also it's an  \ninteresting thing that people should learn from \nthat you don't have to start with every single  \nfeature that you want to build eventually. Start \nwith the thing that's going to get the hook of  \npeople and that you think is still providing value \nand then you can add things on later. So I think  \nthat's really smart. Yeah. Like now I always say \nthat we still are LVP of course that we are pretty  \npretty pretty validated. So, but I still see as \nIMTP because it's just one feature and on on the  \napp we're going to start with like 10 different. \nSo, I can I we have community, we have power,  \nwe have content, we have like all of the stuff to \nmake the to make this full circle and we started  \nonly with background chat. So, I think it's \nalways pretty good start with something then wait  \nto start with the perfect product. Yeah, totally. \nAnd and for the for the mobile app you mentioned,  \nare you can you use Lovable for that or are you \ngoing to use another AI tool or are you using it?  \nIt was going to be my dream to be honest useable \nfor that, but it could take a while until they  \nmake this possible. But for the app, we we have \nnow I have now another co-founder with me who  \nis the CTO in his building because we are talking \nabout safety. We will talk about things that if we  \ndo anything wrong, a woman can die. So I so I can \nI I I not I can trust I I I borrow that. So I was  \nlike oh and my my other co-founder he was like no \nlet's let's uh let's learn Flutter flow and let's  \ndo it. And I was like no first I hate coding. So \nlike my thing is marketing and I was like I want  \nto make sure that the product is correct like it's \nworking. So, we have an hour a CTO and a full-time  \ndeveloper that they are developing the app and \netc. Got it. That makes sense. That makes sense.  \nUm, yeah. I mean, it's it's an amazing story that \nyou've gone so quickly to this and I think there's  \na lot of lessons for people of how to start, \nhow to grow, and how to think about things. So,  \nI really appreciate you you coming on and talking \nabout it. I guess is there anything else you think  \npeople you want to share or that you know people \nmight want to take away? Yeah, I think my take  \naway from building blink is that yes, first thing \nfirst just one thing at once. So for example,  \nwe we have just one feature I could put like 10 \ndifferent things inside the platform now and I  \nwill have people using and paying and etc. Test \ntest test is what you have to have in mind. So I  \ntest price, I test different things from different \nplaces to understand like what is work but I have  \na documentation from this test to understand \nwhy I'm testing what is the the results and  \netc. So this is important as well and I think like \nbuild do do things. I see a lot of people I know a  \nlot of really talented people who don't build \nthings because they have afraid. Oh if nobody  \nbuy it. Oh if it doesn't work. Oh but just do it \nlike I don't know if this the price is correct. I  \nalways say the same thing. I didn't know as \nwell like I knew that the product was okay  \nand I I always hear the user is always trying to \nunderstand etc. So from that is all about test and  \ndo it and don't have afraid to to learn. So like \nI'm a learner everything like I learn English by  \nmyself and I learned Spanish by myself. I learned \nmarketing by myself like I don't have a degree.  \nI started to work with marketing when I was 15. \nSo like learning by yourself and I think if you  \nreally like hey I'm going to sit here I'm going \nto learn and I'm going to test and iterate and  \netc. you will reach something. You will reach \nsomething and and sell. Try to sell. Try because  \nI I I found this is a really common. We have two \nscenarios right here. We have people developers  \nwho know how to build but they spend like years \ndoing the perfect product and never sell because  \nfor them it's not about have clients or sell. \nIt's more about build. And people who don't know  \nhow to build but also has afraid. Oh, I don't \nknow if she's going this people going to do it.  \nju just do it and this is what I did for blink and \nthis is what we continually start to do and also  \nyou can build a company like from zero to whatever \nyou want. So for example when I started blink and  \nI I was working in Asians and my contract was \nfinished I started to work in two different  \ncompanies I still I'm still working now that now \nthat I going to start to be full-time on blink. So  \nme and my co-founder like working in 9 to 5 jobs \nand we do all of this and now we going to we are  \nfundraising. So we're going to we're going to do \na first round only with woman here like we have  \none biggest names in technology here in Brazil \nthat don't invest on us. I have talks with very  \nimportant people like every day all of this come \nfrom the zero. So like build and really try to  \nmake something that people want. I think this \nis this is the main point like forget what you  \nwant. I I don't care for what I like. I care what \nis good for the users. So I think this is would  \nbe the takeaway. That's great. So much good advice \nthere for for people. And I think that these since  \nthese AI tools have have really only been out for \na short period of time, like this is just the the  \nlike tip of the iceberg of all of these companies \nthat I think people are going to start building.  \nUh Sabrin, you're like one of the first, I think, \nwho've like had a lot of success and I think I'm  \nsure there's some others as well, but it's uh \nit's really inspiring, I think, for people to  \nsee what's possible. And then also I think I think \nit also shows that some of the the people who I  \nthink have some of the the most potential now are \npeople who understand the the marketing aspect of  \nit and the idea aspect of it and um like with your \nskill set or people with your skill set who can  \nthen you know now you can have make that product \non your own and start selling it and and that  \num marketing and is turning into maybe even more \nvaluable than of a skill than anything else cuz  \nOh, that's how you get get it out there. Yeah. \nYeah. This is what I think like now if you're a  \ndeveloper, you're just another one. No, no \nmatter that they hate me when I say this,  \nthey hate me. But but I'm real. Like guys, if \nyou're de developer now, you're just another one  \nbecause now of course I understand the complexity. \nI understand everything. But now I really see  \nhow things shifted. Uh I saw one developer on \nTwitter. He's pretty big and he he quoted the  \ntwe made about me. It was like look at this case \nproduct like it's really his question it was like  \nuh I don't think worth be a dev anymore and I \nwas like oh like of course it didn't work and of  \ncourse I think that when you have this tech like \na death with with the with the technical vision  \nwould have made done so much faster than I did. \nBut I think we we really now you you really have  \nto understand that support distribution is about \nsale. I think 247 how we can do more impression  \nshare how we can how we can people can see us \nmore how we can sell more how we can do this  \nlike I have a one of the persons of my team he's \npaid to be on Tik Tok 24/7 like every day just to  \ncatch ideas so we can test I have a team with \n10 uses who post content for us like every day  \nSunday to Sunday we always test different things \nalways looking and not not about this is technical  \nso now if we're a developer we're just another \none so you need or to understand a little about  \nmarketing or to get or to be a co-ounder partner \nwith someone who understands the process so I  \nthink this is this is pretty what what I'm seeing \nright now yeah that makes sense um and then of  \nAnyone who h has the desire now can can learn \nthese things and and start your own your own  \nbusiness and then mix that with your marketing and \nsee if people want to buy it and then just keep  \ngrowing from there and like you're doing build a \nteam and maybe eventually you do need a co a real  \ncoder to you know not real coder but a traditional \nde developer to to build out maybe some more  \nadvanced features but you can worry about that um \nwhen it comes to it and then maybe in a that won't  \neven be necessary also. So who know this thing \nthings are moving moving so quickly. Yeah. Was we  \nare just starting like from April to now lovable \nlike they improve it 200%. A total different  \nproduct. I I I can't even imagine how it's going \nto be in a year. Like I can't I can't even even  \nimagine I can't even think how it's going going \nto be in a year. So it's amazing time for people  \nwith good ideas. Yeah, totally cool. All right, \nso where should people if they want to follow you,  \nfollow your journey, uh where should people do \nthat? Oh, yeah. I'm always I'm always talking on  \nX. So, we're going to we're going to put some all \nmy things here. But I tweet mostly in Portuguese,  \nsometimes in English and in Portuguese. So, just \nuse a translator, but I always talking about  \nmarketing, about what I'm doing here in Blink. \nI'm also start to create content for Link and  \nInstagram as well. there like I going to have some \nEnglish videos but you can send me questions and  \netc. English mainly on Instagram. I open every \nday uh a question box so you can ask. I always  \nput like ask me everything. So I always respond \nthere as well and I have no problem responding  \nEnglish. So that's it. I'm all around and now \nrunning because the app is going to be launched  \nin end of October, beginning of November. \nSo we have a lot to do. Cool. Awesome. Well,  \nthank you so much for coming on. We'll put those \nlinks in the description so people can uh find  \nyou easily and I'm excited to see the the future \nof Plinq. Thanks. Yes, me too.
