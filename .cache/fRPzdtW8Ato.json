{"transcript": "﻿Grid trading has become increasingly popular \namongst cryptocurrency traders in the past years   and many crypto exchanges even offer one click \nsolutions to deploy grid trading strategies as,   so to say, “fire and forget” solutions.\nHowever, most traders still end up losing money   with grid trading strategies due to, most \nof the time, not understanding where the   strengths and weaknesses of these strategies \nare, what type of market phases to use them   in and/or using far too much leverage.\nOn today’s episode of “The Good, the Bad & the   Bitcoin” I want to explain to you the different \ntypes of grid trading strategies, their strengths   and weaknesses and show you how I personally use \nGrid trading strategies in a process that I call   “continued optimization hedging” to ensure that \nmy strategies are always reflecting the market   reality and not just wishful thinking.\nHi, welcome back, good to see you again! \n  If you know already everything about the different \ntypes of GRID strategies such as “long grid,   short grid, neutral grid and hedging grid” \nfeel free to fast forward a bit to the second   part of this video where I talk about my own grid \nstrategies, how to set them up and how to monitor   them. Also if you are interested in monitoring \nhow my personal strategies are developing,   which exact settings I apply to my GRIDs and \nhow I optimize them on a weekly basis I have   created a new Telegram Channel only dedicated \nto this. It is totally free and I think it is   a fun way to learn how to approach GRID \ntrading in a more professional way.\n  But now let’s start by looking at the \ndifferent types of GRID strategies\n  A grid trading strategy is a type of \ntrading strategy that aims to profit   from the natural market volatility of \nan asset, for example a cryptocurrency,   by placing buy and sell orders at regular \nintervals above and below a predefined base price.   The \"grid\" in this context refers to the series \nof levels at which trades are triggered.\n  Once the price of the asset you are trading, \nin this example Bitcoin/USDT reaches one of   these lines or GRID points on the chart an order \nis executed. This can be either a long entry,   a short entry, a Take profit, a long and short \nentry at the same time or a mixture of all,   depending on the exact GRID \nstrategy you are using.\n  The most common forms of grid strategies \nyou will encounter are:\n  “Long Grids”, that only use long, or buy orders, \nthat are placed at the levels below the current   market price that are then exited once grid lines \nabove the current price are reached. \n  A short grid does the same thing as a long grid \nbut naturally is aiming to capitalize on falling   prices, so would typically be something \nyou want to use in a bear market.\n  So called neutral-grid strategies are designed \nto capitalize on trending, or sideways markets,   where the price fluctuates between price points, \nthat are, for example, defined by zones of support   and resistance. Typically here short or sell \norders are executed when the price rises to the   grid points above the current price and long or \nbuy orders are executed when the price falls to   the grid points below the current price. \nAs long as the price is oscillating in the   sideways direction you defined with your grid you \nwill achieve a clear outperformance versus a “buy   and hold” or “short and hold” strategy.\nIf we talk about strengths and weaknesses of   these classic GRID strategies we have to note that \nusually these types of GRIDs work very well in   ranging markets, which is something we actually \nhave seen a lot in cryptocurrencies. \n  However, once a ranging market changes to a \ntrending market, be it an up- or downtrend,   these changes occur often very quick and with very \nhigh volatility in cryptocurrencies. I mean, we   have just seen that this year with Bitcoin phases \nwhere the price jumps up by 15 % from Friday   afternoon to Monday morning or even intraday up \nand downs of almost 10 %. If you are then invested   into a classic market neutral grid or even short \nor long grid you will quickly be sitting on large   losses or even have your account liquidated \nif you were trading with high leverage. \n  While there is no 100 % solution to \nthis problem that can fully protect   your account from underperforming in high \nperformance trending markets there are a   number of things you can do to give yourself \nthe chance to still earn a bit of money when   cryptocurrencies are suddenly starting to moon \nto the upside…or crash to the downside.\n  Instead of using one of the classic \ngrid strategies I am, for example,   using a so-called “Hedge Grid Strategy”.... \nThis means that once one of the price points   on my grid is reached a Long and Short order are \nopened at the same time. At first glance this,   of course, does not make sense because these 2 \norders basically cancel each other out… However,   over time, the realized profits that are taken \nby closing one of the positions once a new grid   line is reached should offset unrealized losses. \nFurthermore, in times where the markets start to   trend very much into 1 direction a hedge grid will \noffset some of your losses and not strain your   margin as much as a classic grid strategy.\nI the next part of this video I will walk you   through the process on how I set up 2 of \nthese Hedge Grid Strategies 9 days ago,   analyze how they have performed until today, \nhow to continuously optimize them and how   you can also do this without having to sit in \nfront of your screens for hours and hours.\n  For this I am using a tool called \nwundertrading.com which allows me to set up,   backtest and optimize GRID bots for the different \ncrypto exchanges I am using. If you want to use   this tool as well you will find a link in \nthe description of this video and a pinned   comment with a link to the tool which will also \ngive you a 10 % discount on their plans.\n  First thing you will notice are 2 segments: One is \ncalled “Popular” where you can find pre-defined,   ready to use bots with their corresponding \nstrategy, for example “Hedge Grid” or   “Classic Grid”. In addition you can choose \nfrom Futures and Spot trading bots. \n  I am concentrating on building a bot \nthat trades the future markets for me,   so I click on “advanced”. You can now see \nquite a lot of settings that are available,   allowing you to adjust your personal bot to what \nyou like the most. In my case I want to create   a hedge grid on Bitcoin/USDT with a lowest grid \nprice of 45,000 USD and a highest Grid price of   88,000 USD. Now I have to select the profit \nor distance between each of the grid lines   and the trade size per grid line. \nYou can see here also that when I change   the number of grids from 22 to 50 that \nthe profit per grid changes from 3 % to   1.35 %, basically making my bot more active.\nOne cool thing about wundertrading is that I can   now backtest how my bot would have performed in \nthe last 15 days of trading and you can see that   my bot would have earned 76 USD for me. \n\n  Now, why only 15 days of backtesting? Would \nit not make sense to backtest the strategy on   as much data as possible? Under normal \ncircumstances I would always say: yes,   you have to test your trading strategy \non as much data as possible. However,   as grid trading strategies are very sensitive to \nchanges in trend and volatility plus over time   will start to accumulate positions with unrealized \nlosses it is, in my opinion, essential to adjust a   grid strategy to new and updated settings at least \nevery 2 weeks….even better every 7 days. From my   experience this really is the essential part \nof being successful with grid strategies.\n  \nOne very nice feature of Wundertrading   is the possibility to automatically optimize \nmy strategy to what would have been the best   settings for my selected Grid range. This \nbasically takes the effort of adapting my   strategy to the latest real market volatility \noff my shoulders and is really overall a very   useful setting. I can then also apply these \noptimized settings with just 1 mouse click. \n  I then just activated the bot \nby clicking on “Create Bot”   to let it start to automatically trade my \nstrategy on the exchange I connected. \n  Later that day I, by the way, created another \nbot with 100 Grids instead of 55 to kind of   see how the 2 would differ in performance over \nthe course of the next couple of days. \n  One thing you probably have noticed is that I just \nchose an investment of 100 USD per Grid despite   having 10,000 USD on each account. General rule \nof thumb to stay on a more conservative side is to   divide the total amount of money you are using for \na grid strategy by the number of GRIDs. So, for   example 10,000 USD divided by 100 GRids = 100 USD \nper Grid. This is, of course, if you wish to not   utilize any leverage at all. If you are planning \non using leverage you can, of course, adjust these   numbers and, for example, use 250, 500 or even \n1,000 USD per Grid in your strategy. However,   be aware that leverage will not just amplify \nyour profits but also your losses.\n  Now, remember how I told you earlier how classic \ngrid trading strategies are very sensitive to   strong trending markets and that I thought that \nusing hedge grid strategies is the better way of   trading grids with cryptocurrencies? My theory \nunderwent a reality check in the next 9 days   with Bitcoin performing by almost 14 % to the \nupside and quite significant volatility to the   upside and sometimes also the downside. \nAfter almost exactly 9 days of trading I   re-checked on my 2 strategies to begin the process \nof optimization again and saw that despite having   had such a strong upside volatility in Bitcoin \nin the past 9 days the strategies still managed   to produce some profits. Of course, these profits \nwere not jaw dropping if compared to the 10,000   USD I used for each strategy but the mere fact \nthat despite market conditions that usually are   deadly for grids my strategies still managed to \nstay in the green numbers showed me that my theory   on the benefits of using hedge grids is working \nquite well. Under normal circumstances with more   sideways ranging markets we probably would have \nseen something between 70 and 120 USD per strategy   in profit, which is, a very good performance \ntaking into account the very conservative   settings I had chosen for the strategies.\nSo, in summary using a hedge grid strategy,   not going too crazy with leverage and optimizing \nplus restarting your grid strategy every 7 to 14   days can, in my opinion, help you to get the best \nout of your own grid trading strategies.\n  That brings us to the end of today’s video. \nIf you want to know how the performance of my   GRIDs continues and you do not want to wait \nfor the next video update on them plus which   settings I am currently using feel free to join \nmy Telegram channel dedicated to these strategies.   Also make sure to leave me a like and subscribe \nto my channel….that is the only way the YouTube   algorithm notices small channels like mine.\nUntil we see each other again: happy investing!", "language": "en"}
