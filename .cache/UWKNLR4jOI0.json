highly requested\nvideo The Ultimate Guide to swing\ntrading for beginners swing trading is a\ngreat way for students or part-time\ntraders who are too busy with a regular\n9 to7 job to make some side income it's\noverall a lot less time consuming than\nday trading and takes less starting\ncapital and a lot less risky if you\nstruggled with day trading or looking at\ncharts all day then swing trading is\ndefinitely for you in today's ultimate\nbeginners guide to swing trading you're\ngoing to learn getting started with\nswing Trading the right mindset and\nexpectations because spoilers you're not\ngoing to start banking Lamborghinis in\ntwo months then you'll learn about\ntechnical analysis for swing trading\nyou'll learn about the time frames as\nwell as indicators next we'll talk about\nswing trading chart patterns my\nrecommended swing trading brokers and\nlast but not least once you've gone\nthrough all the foundation listed above\nthen you're ready to learn my favorite\nswing trading strategy as always if you\nenjoy educational video like this please\nremember to drop a like down below and\nsubscribe to see more first let's start\nwith how to get started with swing\ntrading why should you even choose swing\ntrading in the first place over day\ntrading through my many years of day\ntrading I've seen many pro day Traders\ngradually transition to swing trading\nand there are very good reasons for that\nwhen you day trade you entering\npositions inaday often in the first two\nhours of the market open and you are\nclosing the position in the same day in\na couple hours minutes or sometimes in\nseconds this kind of environment is very\nfast-paced high adrenaline and yes you\ncan make a lot of money really fast but\nyou could also lose that same amount of\nmoney just as fast so it's really really\nstressful and after over 10 years of day\ntrading in that kind of high stress\nenvironment I wanted to slow down a\nlittle bit so that's the reason I\nstarted swing trading a lot more last\nyear so in trading means instead of\nholding a position for a couple seconds\nminutes or hours you're holding the\ntrade for more than one day sometimes\nweeks or even months so you can see just\nfrom the longer holding period for your\npositions that means you don't have to\ncare about the intraday fluctuations of\nday trading which also means you don't\nneed to sit in front of the computer\nlooking at charts all day looking at\ntickers it's less time consuming overall\nand generally it's less stress for the\nTrader and requires a lot less Capital\nnow of course there's also downside to\nswing trading as well I'm not just going\nto talk about the good and not the bad\nbecause of everything I shared earlier\nswing trading generally leads to slower\naccount growth compared to day trading\nat least for most swing Traders you can\nalso flip the other way around as well\nand see swing trading as less risky and\nit's less likely that new Traders will\nlose their entire trading account in one\nday because that's something that's very\npossible in day trading trust me I've\nseen that happen to many day Traders and\nhad that happen to myself as well when I\nwas starting out as a beginner so if\nyou're actually interested in learning\nswing trading then you just need to be\nprepared for a much slower action\ninstead of using the fast-paced intraday\ncharts you should be looking at the\ndaily stock charts or even the weekly\ncharts and don't worry we'll be going\nthrough all the technical analysis and\nchart patterns in the next section of\nthe video If everything I just said\nsounds appealing to you then let's move\non to the next part technical analysis\nfor swing trading now let's dive into\nthe exciting part of technical analysis\nfor swing trading we'll be talking about\ncharting time frames indicators and\nsupply and demand key levels let's start\nwith the most important aspect charting\ntime frame in trading time frame of a\nchart refers to a length of time that\nthe trend is presented in a market it is\nused by both day Traders and swing\ntraders to analyze price movements and\nmake decisions based on their trading\nStyles and strategies so in day trading\nmost Traders will use smaller time\nframes such as the 1 minute chart or the\nfive minute chart but in swing trading\nthe lowest time frame most Traders use\nis the daily chart then the weekly chart\nand sometimes even the monthly chart if\nyou think about it this makes a lot of\nsense you're holding positions for days\nweeks or even months instead of a couple\nof minutes so you shouldn't let every\nsingle tick on smaller time frames\ndistract you from the bigger picture and\nthat's why the daily chart which you can\nsee up here this is a default for most\nswing Traders this is the chart I use\nthe most as well as the weekly chart\nthat you can see over here I only use\nsmaller time frames such as the 5 minute\ncharts or the 15 minute charts that you\ncan see here to execute my\norders next let's talk about the concept\nof supply and demand this is a very\nimportant aspect of technical analysis\nto understand especially if you're doing\ntechnical swing trading which is the\nkind of strategy I'll be sharing with\nyou later in the video on the daily\nchart over here you can see we have the\nstock Google have you heard of them you\ncan see backing around like what June of\nuh last year the stock peaked around\nthis 190s area and pull back all the way\ndown to this area let's call it one 168\n165s here and then bounced off and went\neven lower to\n155 then down here to let's call it 149\nat each of the lines that we just drawn\nyou can see that the stock after selling\noff from these levels it kind of bounced\noff that area multiple times you can see\nhere it bounced off this 164s went back\nup to 173s and went even lower to\n155s came back up to 160 you know 5S\narea and sold off to 150s and after that\nbouncing over back to the levels of 165s\nagain and the reason the stock bounced\nat these Green Line these areas because\nthey were buyers there waiting to buy\nthe stock there is demand there which is\nwhy these areas are called demand zone\nor support Zone in general these are\nareas of interest for buyers and these\nare the areas where you should look for\nyour potential swing trading entries now\nback to the Chart here you can see that\nafter the stock bounced off these green\nlines it went all the way back up to the\n174s area after it bounced here it went\nback to 164s 150s back to 164s then it\nwent back to highs over here around 180s\nthen again after it bounced off this\nsupport area went back to New highs\naround the 190s which talked about and\neven 200 up here and after the stock\nPeaks at these red lines areas it pulled\nback meaning that after hitting those\nlevels you can see the stock go back\ndown lower sometimes even selling off\ndrastically you can see that will be the\nexample here after hitting this 181s it\nsold off drastically back down and 20\npoints lower same thing here after it\nhit 200 it pulled all the way back down\nto 188\nand the reason the stock pulls back at\nthese red lines that you see here on the\nscreen is because there were sellers\nthere waiting to sell the stock and get\nrid of it there is Supply that's why\nthese areas are called Supply zones or\nresistance basically the opposite of\ndemand or support these resistance areas\nare where you should look for potential\nexit to sell and take profit on your\nswing trading positions I do want to\nmake one thing clear though these\nsupport and resistance lines are not\njust some magical line that the stock\ncandles just bounce off for no reason\nthese lines or zones represent\nsignificant price levels that people\nhave historically agreed to sell or to\nbuy so we must make sure to chart these\nareas out because it's likely that it\nwill happen again but it's never\nguaranteed next let's talk about\nindicators on the daily chart and I will\nwill specifically be speaking about\nindicators that I use for swing trading\nbefore we continue if you're enjoying\nthis very comprehensive video guide on\nswing trading so far please remember to\ndrop a like down below so even more\npeople interested in swing trading will\nsee this video and I really appreciate\nit okay now continuing with indicators\nfirst of all indicators are very\nsubjective every swing Trader uses\ndifferent pairs of indicators for me I\nuse the daily SMA here which is the\npurple line you see on the daily chart\nthe simple moving average as well as the\n8 EMA which is this orange line that you\nsee that's a lot shorter this is the 8\nEMA exponential moving average and on\ntop of this pair of indicators I of\ncourse use volume which is the volume\nbar you can see at the bottom over here\nokay let me talk about each of these\nindicators I use in details here and\nbreak it down to you why I like to use\nthem so that start with the 8 EMA again\nthat's the Orange Line you see over here\n8 EMA is a momentum indicator I use it\nto see if a stock is currently\nuptrending in a breakout or\nconsolidating for either a move up or\ndown for example you can see this stock\nR GTI it's been breaking out and riding\nand shooting up along this Atma this\nvery strong momentum another example\nover here you can see the stock is\nbreaking out pull back consolidate and\nbreak out higher along this uptrend on\nthe 8 EMA I will explain even more about\nthese chart patterns in the next section\nof the video but for now you just need\nto know that you can use this 8 EMA to\nwrite momentum on your swing trades to\nthe upside the next indicator we'll talk\nabout is 200 SMA simple moving average\nwhich is the the purple one that you can\nsee over here the purple line here\nthat's the 200 SMA the 200 SMA is a key\nindic Ator used by Traders and Market\nanalysts to determine the long-term\ndirection of a stock like the number\nsuggests 200 SMA it's a very long-term\nmoving average this line you see this\npurple line essentially calculates the\naverage of the stock price over the last\n200 days and why do you need to know\nthis as a swing Trader in general stocks\nbelow 200 SMA is considered weak and not\nideal for swing trading or investing on\nthe long side and vice versa stocks\nabove the 200 SMA is considered bullish\nand more ideal for swing trading or\ninvesting again this is all just\ntechnicals of course we're not talking\nabout fundamentals and because of this\nvery general concept I do not swing\ntrade stocks below the 200 SMA or at\nleast not with the strategy that I'll be\nteaching you today okay let's talk about\nthe third indicator this is pretty\nuniversally used for most day Traders\nand swing Traders Traders and that is\nvolume this is the volume indicator here\ndown here below the volume indicator\nshows you A visual representation of how\nmany shares of a stock is traded in a\nsingle time period so at the bottom\nvolume bar here you can see the volume\nfor each of these daily candles so you\ncan see on this day the stock Goog\nGoogle stocks traded 97 million shares\nand on these lower days it traded only\nabout 52 million million volume is an\nimportant indicator I Ed it help with\nentering my swim positions as well as\nexiting for a loss or take profit we'll\ngo through the details with actual\nexamples in the next\nsection okay let's talk about chart\npatterns shall we this is often a very\nhighly debated Topic at least in day\ntrading and often quite skeptical about\nall these chart patterns that you see\nhere that you can memorize and print out\non the internet\nwhen they are used for intraday in day\ntrading just like technical analysis\nchart patterns are subjective but for\nswing trading large cap stocks\nspecifically I actually really enjoy\nusing them not because these patterns\nwork 100% of the time again nothing in\ntrading is ever guaranteed but because\nI've seen these daily chart patterns for\nswing trading repeat again and again in\nthe past for large cap stocks the reason\nfor that is because when you're swing\ntrading the charts are a little bit more\nforgiving and you have the luxury of\ntime to let the trade work out and show\nyou whether the pattern or the setup you\nhave in mind is indeed working out or\nsetting up as you had expected so in\ngeneral there are three chart patterns\nthat I want to share with you today and\nthese are especially important if you\nwant to become a swing Trader the first\nchart pattern is the breakout pattern\nthis is an important one so pay\nattention this breakout chart pattern is\na foundation of the Swing trading\nstrategy that we're covering in this\nvideo again this is my favorite strategy\nso let's talk about what is a breakout a\nbreakout is a price action that occurs\nwhen a stock is breaking through a daily\nresistance now you can see that we're\nstarting to tie all the technical\nanalysis Concepts we learned earlier so\nlet's take a look at this Tesla chart\nnow on the daily chart you can see that\non the daily chart there's some\nsignificant resistance here so that's\ndraw all the resistance as you learn how\nto do so earlier around this 165 you can\nsee another resistance here tested once\nand twice around here 158 okay let's\njust use these two for now so you can\nsee at both of these resistance the\nstock tested many times that 165 area\nonce here another time here one more\ntime here and once it gets finally gets\nabove those resistance that has tested\nprevious previous times it finally\nexplodes remember a breakout is only\nstrong if a stock has already tested\nthat resistance a couple of times before\nusually at least two or three times one\nmore time here you can see the stock\ntested that 159 area here one around\nNovember of last year one more time\nagain couple weeks later and one more\ntime here and boom once it breaks out\nthe breakout here is explosive through\nthat key resistance level\nand you might be able to tell by now\njust from the screen sharing demo here\nwhy this is my favorite chart pattern\nfor swing trading once a stock breaks\nout of a multi-week or multi-month\nresistance it can continue going for\nmultiple days just like Tesla here from\n158 all the way to\n483 that's more than 100 points per\nshare so let's take a look at some of\nthe examples of a breakout um peners\nanother one over here you can see once\nit broke through that resistance here at\n44s there's no going back and there's\nanother example here you can see some\nresistance here around this area here\nit's tested that once twice three more\ntimes and then it breaks out and goes a\nlot higher one more you can see this is\na crazy mover last year MST once it gets\nthrough these long-term resistance this\nis a multi-month resistance here here\nhere and one more time here around\nOctober or November then you has a huge\nbreakout uh from 178 all the way to\n$500 we will return to these breakout\ncharts later when I share with you the\nswing trading strategy so make sure you\nremember these okay now let's talk about\nthe second chart pattern which is the\nopposite of a breakout breakdown so just\nlike we talked about earlier a breakout\nis when a stock breaks through a key\nresistance then that means a breakdown\nis when a stock breaks down and breaks\nbelow a key support So if you take a\nlook at this djt over here you can see\nsome resistance around here the stock\nbounced off this area here here and here\nyou can see once it broke down that area\nhere 32s it actually broke down a couple\nof times here here one more time and\nthis is the fourth time of a breakdown\nonce that breaks down it sold off all\nthe way from 33s down to $12 so that's\nanother example of a breakdown um\nanother one I think uh AMD has some good\nbreakdown examples you can see back here\nonce it broke through these support\nareas here here each time once it broke\nthrough this long-term support here it\nsold off to the next level down 153s\nwhen that once that breaks down one more\ntime it sold off to the lower level\nsupport at 130s and\n120s the next chart pattern is\nconsolidation chart pattern\nconsolidation is when a stock is trading\nwithin a tight range for a period of\ntime for days or weeks consolidation\nchart pattern is important to identify\nbecause it usually leads to powerful\nbreakouts or breakdowns so let me show\nyou an example here you can see this AMD\nchart before it had a breakout here from\n183s to 220s over here it was trading\nsideways for a while in this range in\nthis range over here this what we call a\nconsolidation it went up to 180s pull\nback down to 163's back to that same\narea tested it many times this is a span\nof you know at least a month actually in\nthis consolidation the stock usually\nneeds to consolidate before a major\nbreakout another example here you can\nsee a smaller and not as you know\napparent consolidation area you can see\nthe stock had to trade around this range\nhere for a while until it break out once\nthat fails it sells off going back to a\nTesla example we had earlier you saw\nthis uh explosive breakout here then\nthat's because that's a result of a\nconsolidation of a stock testing the\nsame resistance and support for a while\nthis is for a couple of weeks here from\nmid November to mid December before it\nwas able to break out you can see not\nevery stock needs to consolidate to\nbreak out or break down but sometimes\nthese consolidation areas will provide\nus swing Traders really good entries to\nget in so you can position yourself with\nthe correct risk reward before the stock\nactually breaks out quick reminder I\nshare a lot of trade ideas for both\nswing trading and day trading and talk\nabout all these daily charts patterns\nthat you just learned I share them in my\nfree weekend watch list in which you can\nsign up for free down\nbelow all right now let's talk about\nswing trading brokers and tools that I\npersonally found very use useful I think\nit's a general good practice to keep\nyour swing trading account separate from\nyour day trading account this way you\ndon't get itchy fingers and take profits\ntoo early on your swing trades when you\nare day trading the same ticker or\nhaving a bad day in day trading because\nthat's happened to me many times before\nthe Brokers I like to use for swing\ntrading are Centerpoint Securities and\ninteractive brokers I'll leave links to\nany sign up promotions down below I\nactually really like the mobile app for\ninteractive brokers I often times just\nexecute my entries or take profit while\nbeing on the phone they also allow you\nto use OC orders or bracket orders on\nthe mobile app which is very convenient\nand allows you to manage your day trades\nor swing trades very easily I use both\ninteractive brokers and Centerpoint\nSecurities to execute the swing trading\nstrategy that we'll cover in the next\nsection other Brokers that you can also\ncheck out and consider are Weeble they\nalso have really good mobile interface\nand the desktop is pretty friendly as\nwell to beginners and they're commission\nfree only in the US for charting wise I\nrecommend using trading view I use them\nfor all the demos you see in this video\nokay let's talk about the exciting part\nthat you've all been waiting for my\nfavorite and very simple technical\nbreakout strategy for swing trading\nthere's a three-step process to the\nswing strategy step number one which is\nfinding stocks to swing trade okay let's\ncover this now this is a very important\naspect before we go to the entries and\nexit portion of the strategy I always\nuse a scanner to find stocks that fit my\nswing trading criteria during the middle\nof the day after 12:00 p.m. eastern time\nthis is perhaps the biggest difference\nin terms of my stock scanning process\nbetween day trading and swing trading\nfor day trading I usually scan for\nstocks to trade during premarket hours\nbut for swing trading though I will have\nthis swing trading scanner that you see\non the screen over here I'll have this\non during the middle of the day after\n11:00 a.m. Market time an idea for this\nscan template is very simple I'm simply\nlooking for stocks large cap stocks that\nhave already started gaining volume and\nmomentum earlier in the day and I want\nto get in for even more follow through\nduring the breakout move on the daily\nchart so to do that you can see here\nopening up the templates here I'm\nlooking for stocks greater than a dollar\nper share I'm looking for stocks greater\nthan 1 billion market cap again I don't\nlike to trade penny stocks or small caps\nfor swing trading it's too much gamble\nyou either wake up broke or you wake up\nrich and I always wake up broke for\nvolume I want to see at least 500k for\nthe middle of the day and I want to see\nthat the stock has already moved up at\nthis positive on the day 3% and you can\nsee once you update the set here in a\nscanning template it shows me a bunch of\ndifferent ideas that fit the criteria I\nhad inputed this is a stock scanner I\nhelp develop in order to fit my trading\nstrategies and my Styles all the\nsettings I mentioned earlier is\nbasically in this midday movers for\nlarge cap swings template so every time\nI'm scanning for swing ideas I just\nclick this during the middle of the day\nand the scanner will show me a list of\npotential swing trading ideas for\nexample you can see this top idea here\noo I know the stock is about to break\nout just from looking at the chart you\ncan see it's testing that daily\nresistance once it breaks out you'll be\nprime for another move to the upside\nokay once you have this list of\npotential ideas you're ready to move on\nto step number two step number two\nTechnical and chart pattern analysis so\nit's time to bring in a lot of things\nthat you learned earlier the daily\nbreakout chart patterns and the\ntechnical indicators the hdma and 200\nSMA so from the list of ideas that you\nsaw earlier you want to go through the\nlist like I did with OKO earlier and see\nhow the stock is reacting to those two\nEMA pairs so you want to see how they\nare reacting to the 200 SMA and the 8\nEMA so and what I'm looking for\ngenerally speaking is I want to see if a\nstock is hugging and trending along that\norange line here the 8 EMA or if they\nhad recently broken down like you can\nsee on this test that chart here if it\nbroke down I want to see if the stock\nhas a history of reclaiming above that 8\nEMA again so let's take a look at the\noako chart that we saw earlier you can\nsee this oako chart had the history of\nbreaking out along the Atma bouncing off\nit even while it broke down of the Atma\nit was able to reclaim this many times\nonce twice three times and now it's\nattempting to break out again so that's\ngood that's something you want to see\nfor the potential trade idea now where\ndoes the 200 SMA Comm in this is another\nfilter that qualifies the swing\ncandidates remember I wouldn't recommend\nswing trading stocks that under the 200\nSMA even if they are hugging and\nbreaking out along that eight EMA so you\ncan see OKO is well above the 200 SMA\nthat's fine but this AMD here this is\nthe example earlier you can see this is\nnot so I wouldn't recommend this idea\nanother one is Google this is a recent\nidea that I picked up from the scanner a\ncouple weeks ago once you can see the\nstock is well trending above the 200\nsmma reclaiming that Atma after the\nbreakout and it's starting to\nconsolidate we talked about the daily\nconsolidation chart pattern here you can\nsee it's starting to do that here so\nthis is another idea I have for\nconsolidation along the Atma for a\nbreakout above that resistance some of\nthese tickers that you find on the\nscanner may not be the perfect stock to\ntake for this technical swing trading\nstrategy right away but you should\nalways keep them on a watch lless they\nmight not be ready for the day you found\nthem but they can set up a few days\nlater or a few weeks later for a\nbreakout remember what we mentioned\nearlier swing trading is about taking\nvery few and very selective trades you\nwant quality not quantity step number\nthree executions entries and exits okay\nso we talked about the criteria earlier\nthe stock has to be broken out of a\ndaily resistance in an uptrend along the\n8 EMA and have a history of reclaiming\nthat 8 EMA and big picture wise it needs\nto be above that 200 SMA so let's talk\nabout entries once the stock has proven\nto be riding along the Atma after a\nbreakout my ideal entry is as close to\nthe adma trend as possible so if you\ntake a look at this Google example here\nyou can see that previous resist\nresistance is this area here around 19s\nand you can see it has been riding along\nand breaking out of that Atma so if you\nget rid of that consolidation area here\nthat we're seeing then I want to get in\nas close to that 8 EMA as possible again\nremember we are swing trading not day\ntrading you not looking for position or\nentries precisely to the scent you're\njust making sure that your overall trend\nand direction is enough for you to\ncapture the breakout move so obviously\nyou want to get in as close to atem as\npossible and ideally not on these at Ma\nbreakout around 200 like I would wait\nfor it to pull back closer to 190s or\neven right below the 8 EMA so if you\nlook at this Tesla example here you're\nlooking to get in along these eight EMA\nconsolidation areas here around 330s 3\n40s and as for exit you're looking to\nsell into any major EMA breakouts\nhopefully for a profit so you can see\nlike for this one you want see right\nalong the Atma once it starts pulling\naway from that orange line like here and\nhere again and here especially that's\nwhen you should take your profit I\nusually like to sell my swim positions\nin partial sizes in quarters actually so\nI'll sell 1/4 into the breakout another\n1/4 and keep at least half to continue\ntrailing along the ATM and once I've\ntaken partial profit the stop has moved\nup to break even and as for the stops\nwill be below 8 EMA if a stock closes\nbelow the Atma like this candle here\nthat's when I would be stopped out as\nyou can see this technical swing trading\nstrategy is very simple requires only\ntwo including volume three in the ators\nand the entry and exit is extremely\nsimple this is the way I see swing\ntrading it's a lot less complex than day\ntrading and the charts overall is more\nforgiving and you have a lot more room\nand time to let the trade work if you\nhave any questions regarding technical\nanalysis for swing trading chart\npatterns swing trading brokers or just\nmy swing trading strategy overall feel\nfree to ask me down below and again you\ncan sign up to my free weekend
