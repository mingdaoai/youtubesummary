{"transcript": "again welcome to the wealth Academy\neducational series I'm Adam coup in this\nsession I'm going to show you the\nsimplest way to make money from the\nstock market even if you're a complete\nidiot with little or no effort\nwhatsoever is that really possible let's\nexplore that before I continue again\nplease read the risk disclaimer by\npausing the video and once you\nunderstand the risk please carry\non great so I got a question for you is\nit possible to achieve between a 10% to\n12% annual return from the stock market\nwith very little or no effort most\npeople say no I don't think so right if\nyou look at most retail investors for\nexample in Singapore where I'm from the\naverage retail investor makes only about\n3 to 5% return a year if they lucky so\nthey will look at this and say\nimpossible how can I make 10% a year\nwith no effort if as a complete idiot\nand I'm telling you that you\ncan how well to answer that question you\nhave to first understand what an index\nis now every stock market has an index\nthat measures its performance and the\nindex is made up of a small basket of\nstocks that represents all the stocks in\nthat particular market for example in\nthe US market there are about 7,000\ncompanies you can buy 7,000 stocks\nso after the 7,000 companies they pick\nthe 30 biggest companies to represent\nthe rest for example you have got 3M\nApple Boeing McDonald's Intel uh General\nElectric Gman sex IBM Coca-Cola sound\nfamiliar these are the 30 biggest\ncompanies in the US so you take the\naverage price of these 30\ncompanies and you it take that price and\nit's known as the Dow Jones in\nIndustrials average or the Dow Jones\nindex so this index represents all the\nstocks in the US of course you've got\nother indices but this Dow Jones is one\nof the biggest\nindices now let's take a look at the US\nmarket over the last 30\nyears represented by the Dow Jones index\nthe 30 biggest\ncompanies\nso if you go back to the last 30 years\nyou notice in the short term the market\nis like a roller coaster right so every\ntime it goes up it comes down it goes up\nit comes down it goes up it comes down\nup and down up and down now if you want\nI can zoom in right like that 30 years\nago and you can see the price went up\nand this was Black Monday this was a\ncrash on Wall Street and a lot of people\nlost faith they thought the market will\nnever recover some people even committed\nsuicide some people gave up and sure\nenough I always say when the last man\njumps off the building bum the market\ngoes higher right and then it comes down\nagain it goes up again it comes down it\ngoes up again and he went all the way\nup okay on a huge bu run and then you\nwent through a recession over here this\nwas 20 in the year 2000 to\n2002 right this was a dot bubble crash\ntogether with um the 9/11 terrorist\nattacks over here and then sure enough\nwhen everyone give up hope they said the\nmarket will never recover you know I lo\nlost all my money they give out on the\nmarket the market went even higher as\nusual and on October 2007 we had the\nsubprime financial crisis when Leman\nBrothers collapsed and the stock market\ncollapsed by about\n55% was one of the biggest crashes in\nhistory and sure enough when everyone\nthought that the US market will never\nrecover that that was the end Boom the\nmarket went higher again\nto 18,000 points and recently because of\nthe crash in China and oil price\ncollapse we're down to 16,000 points but\nnonetheless if you look back from where\nwe started to where we are think about\nit there was a huge increase so the\npoint is this in the short term the\nMarket's volatile it goes up and now\nlike a roller coaster but in the long\nterm it always goes up in the long term\nthe market makes higher highs as you can\nsee higher high\npoints and higher low\npoints so the question is this has\nhappened for the last 150 years since\nthe market began so the question is 10\nyears from now 20 years in the future\nwould the index be higher than it is\ntoday and the answer is a guaranteed yes\nnow why is it yes I mean why can't it go\ndown and never come back there are three\nreasons why the first reason is\ninflation so you can bet that 10 years\nfrom now a big ma would cost more than\ntoday 10 years from now a Nike shoe\nwould cost more than today so even if\ncompanies don't grow they sell the same\nnumber of shoes and burgers because each\nitem is priced\nhigher their sales revenue and net\nprofit will be higher because of\ninflation hence the value of the company\nwhich is based on earnings and profits\nwill definitely be higher and stock\nprices always adjust to profits and\nearnings the second reason is population\ngrowth so you can bet 10 years from now\nthere'll be more people on\nEarth because more people are born than\npeople die so more people means more\ndemand for goods and services so Nike\nhas to sell more sh shoes McDonald's is\ngoing to sell more hamburgers so the\ncompanies have to keep growing to supply\na bigger population and hence companies\nwill always grow\nindefinitely but say but Adam don't some\ncompanies die and don't some companies\ngo bankrupt well here's the thing index\nchanges the 30 companies that make up\nthe index are not always the same 30\ncompanies they change all the time the\nmoment a company does not do well it's\nlosing money it get it it it gets kicked\nout the index and replaced by a better\ncompany so for example City Group AIG\nGeneral Motors they were in the Dow\nJones about five years ago but they've\ngot kicked out because they're not doing\nwell and they're replaced by you know\nApple Nike visa and so it's always the\nbest 30 companies that represent the\nMarket that make up the index and that's\nthe reason why the index always goes\nhigher so if you know that the index\nwill always go up in the long term not a\nstock a stock can drop and never recover\nbut the index will always go up what\ncould you do well\nsimple buy and just close your eyes\nbecause imagine 30 years ago in 1986 if\nyou bought the 30 companies in the index\nand you close your eyes and it went up\nand down you didn't care you just kept\nholding on right and you open your eyes\ntoday would you have made money yeah how\nmuch would you have made you have made\nthe Graden of this line from roughly 500\npoints on the Dow\nJones to 17,000 points\ntoday that's a\n91% increase in your wealth if you\nannualize it on an annual basis that's\nan 8.34%\nannual capital\ngain together with a dividend yield of\nabout 3% that's about\n11.84% annualized return for 30 years so\nthat answers my question can you make\nbetween 10% to 12% annual\nreturns with no effort and the answer is\nyes you just buy the index and you hold\nit for the long-term ring the ups and\ndown specific year-to-year gains and\nlosses on the US markets this the S&P\n500 over the last 65 years and the S&P\n500 is just another one of the indices\nthat measures the US markets and he\nmoves together the Dow Jones so you can\nsee 1957 the market increased by\n16% the next year it went up by 11% and\nnext year it went down by\n6.7% you can see over 65 years there\nwere more winning years than losing\nyears and that is why in the end you\nalways make money if you hold long\nenough now what if you just help for a\nyear so imagine if you bought the US\nindex in January and you sold it in\nDecember just held it for a year and you\ndid it randomly right with no strategy\nyou just threw a du what's your chance\nof making money well out of 65 years you\ncan count there were 13 losing years\nwhich means\nstatistically your chance of making\nmoney over a onee per period will be\n74% your chance of losing money will be\n26% is that good hey that's not bad\nconsidering the fact that there's no\nstrategy it's pure random chance luck\nand that's better than any Cino game you\ncan play so I don't understand why would\nanyone go to the casino when they can\nget at best 5050 chance of winning when\nin a stock market you have a 74% chance\nof making\nmoney purely true love holding it for\njust one year now if you held it for two\nyears five years 10 years 15 years it's\n100% chance of making money if you hold\nit long enough now again this doesn't\napply to one stock the stock of a\ncompany can drop and never come back but\nthe index will always go high because\nit's the best 30 companies which they\nchange all the\ntime now the same thing applies for any\nother Market this is\nSingapore for the last 28 years years\nand you can see if you bought it 28\nyears ago writing the ups and downs of\nthe financial crisis and a doom crash\nand you open your eyes today you would\nstill have a gain of about\n7.28% annualized return not as great as\nthe US market but still a positive\nbetter than the fixed deposit rate you\nget at the banks\nright that's the Malian Market over the\nlast 18 years the annualized return is\nabout 8.88%\nof course you have to factor in the\ncurrency as well so if you invest in\nMalaysia this would be in the\nring how about Indonesia well if you\nbought the Indonesian stock market index\nfor the last 18 years and again you\nwrote the ups and downs you would have\nreturn 16.26%\nthe Hong Kong market returned roughly\nabout 11.3% over the last 18 years to\n2015 so what's the lesson lesson is very\nsimple you can potentially make based on\nhistorical performance between 10 to 12%\nannual returns with little or no\neffort even if you're complete idiot\nsimply by buying and holding the index\nfor the long term and so far the US\nindex has given the best performance as\ncompared to any other index in the world\nespecially when you factor in the US\ndollar so how do you buy the index of\nthe different markets well we buy the\nindex using exchange traded funds or\nETFs so in my live trading courses in my\nonline trading courses you learn exactly\nhow you buy the ETFs you know what\nBrokers to use what price to buy them at\nwhat price to sell them\nat back in\n2006 I was one of the first people in\nSingapore to actually promote ETF or\nexchange traded funds buying the\nSingapore STI ETF the US Dow Jones ETF\nand I was featured on the P's magazine\nby the Singapore Stock Exchange I was\none of the first people to teach about\nETFs now let's look at the last seven\nyears from 2009\nto 2015 to end\n2015 this is the Dow\nJones\nETF and you can see seven years ago it\nwas selling at roughly $70 per share per\nETF and if you bought it at $70 and you\njust held on to it today it's worth\nabout $175 us per share that's a\n150% return over 7 years so if you\nannalize it it's about a 13.98% return\nwhich again beats your fixed deposit\nrates at a bank any time of the\nday now if you're wondering what a 10 or\n12 or 133% return can do to your wealth\nover the longterm check this\nout a 12% annual return will make an\naverage income earner a millionaire even\nif you're a complete idiot without much\neffort let me show you the MS let's\nassume an annual income of $60,000 a\nyear or $5,000 a month you know a\nhousehold income if you\nwill if you work for 30 years until you\nretire that is 60,000 multiply by 30\nyears that's $1.8 million you have\nearned in your entire lifetime of\nworking but for most people they won't\nsee that 1.8 million why they spent it\nall away they say I don't have time to\nsave that money\nbut what if you were to just save 10% of\nyour salary is that possible I'm sure it\nis so imagine every year you save\n$6,000 and you invest it in the index\nETF and again the US markets have given\nthe best returns you just buy the ETF\nyou close your eyes you hold it for the\nlong term all right and you let it\ncompound at an average of 12% a year\nright how much would you have at the end\nof 30 years well 6,000 a year\ncompounding at 12% for 30 years becomes\n$1.6 million which is\nalmost $1.8 million and what that means\nis this it means if you just invest 10%\nof your salary into the index passively\nwith no effort you make back close to\n80% of everything you earning your\nlifetime and that's the power of\ncompounding and that's the power of the\nstock market now again I'm not saying\nthat you can only get 12% or 10% I'm\nsaying the 10 to 12% is a passive method\nwith no effort even if you're a complete\nidiot but if you put in effort and you\nlearn how to be an active investor the\nright strategies you can make a lot more\nthan 10 to 12% return you can make\ndouble or triple the amounts but those\nare in my videos to come so for now this\nis Adam coup\nfrom wealth Academy I hope you've\nlearned something take care and I'll see\nyou
