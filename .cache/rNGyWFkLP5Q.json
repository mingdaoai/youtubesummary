{"transcript": "Also new this morning.\nThe stock market\nhas been rising.\nAmericans have more money\nin stocks than ever before.\nEconomists are warning\nthat could be a problem\nand that a market downturn\ncould hit Americans\nharder than ever before.\nCNN's Matt Egan,\nlooking into this one for us\nthis morning.\nWhat do you see, Matt?\nWell, Kate,\nthis is a double\nedged sword, right?\nWhen markets are booming\nlike they have been, market\nrallies can really\nbe a very good thing\nfor the economy.\nEach record high\ncan inspire confidence.\nGet people\nto spend more money, right.\nGo out to dinner, buy a car,\ntake a vacation.\nOf course,\nthe problem\nis that it really does\ncut both ways,\nbecause they're also exposed\nto potential market meltdowns\nthat have happened in the past.\nAnd these really are\nhistoric levels of exposure.\nIf you look at stock\nholdings, direct and indirect,\nlike through 401 K's\nand retirement plans.\nStocks make up 45% of household\nfinances, right? Almost half.\nThat's the most on record\nthat goes back to the 1950s.\nAnd when you look\nat the trend here,\nyou can see that\nthis is really,\nreally increased\nin terms of how much of\npeople's portfolios\nstocks take up.\nLook at this.\nIt go back to 1980.\nIt was just 13% today it's 45%.\nNow one thing\nI would note though is that\nthis doesn't cut equally right.\nThe top 10% of households\nactually own 87% of the stocks,\nbut still,\nthe higher income households,\nthose are the ones\nthat are really keeping\nthis economy afloat.\nAnd if there's\na market reversal,\na downturn, well,\nthey could stop spending.\nAnd I think that\nthis really does underscore\nwhy it was so critical\nthat that market meltdown\nthat we saw in March\nand in April\nover the president's\ntariffs stopped.\nRight now, if it didn't,\nit could have caused\na self-fulfilling prophecy,\nit actually causing\na recession.\nOf course,\nthe president blinked\non those tariffs.\nHe paused them\nfor a period of time.\nAnd the market's\nreally been off\nlike a rocket ship\never since then.\nThe S&P 500 has gained\n$15 trillion in value\njust since April 8th.\nStunning figure.\nI think the bottom line\nis, Kate,\nyou and I often talk\nabout how\nthe market is\nnot the real economy,\nbut I do think that this record\nhigh exposure\nshows that the market does have\na significant influence\non the economy,\nfor better or worse.\nIt's a really good point.\nThank you, Matt.", "language": "en", "title": "Record-high stock ownership raises red flags among economists"}
