{"transcript": "If you clicked on this video, chances\nare you're trying to build your first\napp that at least makes some amount of\nmoney. For those who don't know me, I'm\nBenji. I built 15 apps in the past eight\nmonths and acrewed 80K users.\n[Music]\nHello. So, this section I'm going to go\nthrough everything that involves legal\nwhen it comes to starting your own\nstartup. Doesn't matter whether you have\nthe best app in the world. If you can't\nreceive money legally and pay taxes to\nthe US government, then you don't have a\nbusiness. So having your business ready\nbefore launching the app is extremely\ncrucial because the entire timeline of\nhaving your company ready and also\nhaving your bank account ready and also\nhaving your app developer account ready.\nYou know, it's going to take a while.\nFor us, it took around two to three\nweeks. So definitely if you are starting\nyour app and you're looking forward to\npublishing it in the near future, it is\nvery important that you are legally\nincorporated in the United States to do\nbusiness as a business entity.\nSo I'll go through the three business\nentities in the US right now and why I\nthink LLC, which is the first type of\nbusiness entity, is the best entity to\ngo for. So the three business entities\nin the US are limited liability company\nLLC, second would be CC Corp and thirdly\nwould be S corp.\nWell, if you are a startup looking to\nfund raise from VC venture capital firms\nand you're seeking investments,\nyou want to be a Ccorp, right? Because\nCC Corb it's basically a bigger legal\nentity that would allow you to issue pre\nlike pre-tock pre-equity selling\nbasically. But if you are someone\nlooking to bootstrap your entire startup\nand you don't think you are going to get\nVC funding anytime soon then it is the\neasiest and the best decision to go for\nan LLC.\nWhy is that? Well, an LLC is a\nfundamental move for new entrepreneurs\nbecause not only it offers legal\nprotection, but also provides flexible\nmanagement options. So, you if you have\na if it's just you as the startup owner,\nthis is really ideal for you since an\nLLC would enable you to do anything as a\nbusiness even if you only have one\nperson. Well, that's not a the same\nthing with a C corp or S corp. And also,\nif you start off as an LLC, you can move\nup to move up quoteunquote to expand\nyour company to a CC Corp or S Corp in\nthe future. So, that's definitely\nsomething you can consider doing. It's\nnot like you have to reapply for a CC\nCorp or you can only stick with either\nLLC, Sorb, or CC Corp in any way.\nOkay. So, what is an LLC? LLC is a\nlimited liability company. Basically,\nthe reason for having a limited\nliability company is that if your\ncompany ever gets sued, people can only\ngo after the business assets like the\nmoney in the business bank account\nrather than your own personal savings.\nSo, if you are an quote unquote equity\nholder in an LLC and you get sued and\nthere is $10 in the LLC bank account,\nall they can do is go after those money\ninstead of your own personal savings.\nSo, and second would be the tax\nflexibility since it would allow you to\nchoose how you are taxed. Since if you\nare a sole proprietor, which is which\nbasically means there's only one person\nin your company, which is yourself, or\nyou're a partnership, which me and\nGabriel my co-founder is, then there's a\nlot of flexibility in terms of your\ntaxation. You have to fill up some\nforms, which you can do with Turboax\nfrom in it, which is very easy.\nThirdly, LLC would enable you to build\ncredibility, right? Having an LLC allows\nyou to open a business bank account, you\ncan start building credit from there.\nAnd fourthly, regulator regulatory\ncompliance, basically ensuring\neverything is legal. Since if you're a\nlegal entity as a if you're a legal\nbusiness entity, things you're going to\nbe doing are going to be legal, right?\nSo, that's the best thing with an LLC.\nWell, one thing to avoid, just so you\nknow, is peeling the corporate veil,\nright? So, what does that mean? If you\nmix up your personal funding with your\nbusiness funding and the IRS or the US\ngovernment in general finds out about\nit, then there is a high chance that\nyou're going to lose out on your benefit\nas an LLC where people could potentially\ngo after your personal savings. So what\nwhat do you have to do to actually make\nthat happen so that you can know what to\navoid? Well, mixing up your own personal\nfunding, right? So if you are funding a\nbusiness activity out of your personal\nbank account, that would be mixing up\nyour personal funds and the business\nfunds. And if the government sees that\nyou're you're disregarding the rules of\noperating a business and you're, you\nknow, giving money uh out of your own\npersonal bank account for your business,\nthere's no reason really a reason for\nthe business benefits to be there if\nyou're not going to play by the\nplaybook. So that is a reason why it is\nextremely important to keep your\nbusiness money as business money and\nyour personal money as personal money.\nOkay. Now, how do we establish our own\nLLC? Well, first is coming up with a\nbusiness name that is not taken.\nDifferent states have different\ncompliances. The best and most\nstraightforward way for you is to\nincorporate a Delaware registered LLC\nsince Delaware is one of the most\nbusinessfriendly states in the United\nStates and it's a lot easier to just\nopen up a LLC there with the best bet\nbest tax benefits possible in the US.\nSo, you choose a business name that you\nlike, which you could do through an\nonline service called Stripe Atlas.\nBasically, you go to Stripe and they're\ngoing to handle everything for you. You\nfill out an application, you pay $300\nupfront, $500 for incorporation, and\nafter that, you have to pay $300, I\nthink around $300 per year, and you can\nbasically keep your business alive.\nThat's actually very cheap. The\nalternative route would be other\nsoftware alternatives in which I\nwouldn't recommend because Stripe is\nbest known in the industry. A lot of my\nstartup founder friends, they all use\nStripe Atlas.\nBut also, if you don't want to do the\nsoftware route where these company\nbasically file your company for you, you\nhave to do the traditional paper route.\nYou submit a paper application to the\nUnited States government. It's actually\ngoing to take so long. And my friend,\none of my friend actually did that. It\ntook around two months for him to finish\nincorporating his company which I would\nnot recommend.\nSo definitely first thing first go to\nStripe and you start your company and\nyou incorporate your company right here.\nAnd it's also going to connect you with\nbasically all the resources that you're\ngoing to need for banking, payroll,\naccounting, cloud computing, things like\nthat. And a best thing about Stripe is\nthat if you ever want to push out SAS\nproducts, web tools, the things that\nlike web services, software products\nthat you're going to be pushing out via\na website and web app, then it's best\nyou either go with Stripe or Lemon\nSqueezy, which is another payment\nprovider. But Stripe could enable you to\ncreate a payment page for your web app.\nSo regardless of whether you're building\na mobile app or web app, Stripe would\nenable you to have a business entity and\nyou can charge uh based on that. Of\ncourse, there's going to be transaction\nfees, but that's probably the best\noption out there for you.\nOkay. So after filling out the\napplication which would require your\nsocial security number if you're not in\nthe if you're not a US citizen it is\nbest that you acquire a social security\nnumber and it is best also you have all\nyour legal documents ready your passport\npicture things like that when you are\nfilling out the application. The entire\nprocess takes took us around you know 40\nminutes or so and we just submitted the\napplication. After 3 days, we are\nlegally incorporated in the state of\nDelaware. Now, after incorporation,\nyou're going to obtain an EIN. So, EIN\nstands for employer identification\nnumber. What does that mean? Basically,\ngovernment wants to tax you, they use\nthe EIN to identify you. If you ever\nwant to hire someone, you use an EIN as\nwell. Well, why is EIN important in our\ncase? Because in order to open a\nbusiness bank account, you're going to\nneed an EIN. That is the most important\nthing that you're going to need EIN for.\nAnd at least so far in our business\npractice, we have never had to use EIN\nin any other occasions.\nSo I would recommend using Mercury\nBanking, which is the best banking\nsoftware, not sponsored, best best\nbanking software for startup. Why? It is\nit is really powerful and it's very\nsimple. Once you get the EIN number from\nStripe, you go to Mercury. Then you just\nput in your EIN number and boom, you\nhave a debit card ready ready to use and\nyou have a bank account that you can\nactually connect to apps app store or\nGoogle Play Store. The entire process\nfor Mercury took us about a day. So the\nentire process of incorporating our\ncompany and having our business bank\naccount ready took us less than 5 days.\nSo this is the best way to go about it\nsince it is easily doable and also at\nthe same time has proven to work\nnumerous time for different startup\nfounders. There's not much things you\nhave to look for when it comes to LLC\nformation or business bank account\nbecause it's just there for the sake of\nit. Right? So don't think, oh wait, is\nthere a better alternative stuff like\nthat? Of course, we we all did our fair\nshare of research. So the best thing to\ndo, Stripe for LLC formation, Mercury\nfor banking.\nGreat. So number four would be create an\noperating agreement, which basically\noutlines your LLC's management structure\nand operational procedures. If you're a\nsole proprietorship, meaning there's\nonly one person, aka you, in the\ncompany, you don't need this. But if you\nhave a co-founder, first of all, it's\nvery important that you negotiate your\nown equity structure and how things are\ngoing to run in a company, right? So\nsince you're a legal entity LLC, right?\nSo you're going to have to make sure\nthat things are going to run smoothly,\nwhether the structure would be fing you,\nfing your co-founder, whatever, you have\nto figure out a structure so that the\nLLC's can operate in a good way and\nnobody's are gonna nobody's going to\nhate each other. So that's the most\nimportant thing. Set up a good equity\nstructure. if you have a co-founder or\njust an operating agreement so that the\nLLC could run run smoothly.\nFinally, fulfill state specific\nrequirements. So, if you don't want to\ngo the route that I just told you to\nincorporate incorporate a Delaware LLC,\nthen you're going to have to do a lot of\ndifferent things like notice of intent,\nacquiring business licenses, and pay any\nrequired states fees. If you're using\nStripe, you don't you can disregard\nthis. But I would assume if you're\nwatching this course, you are looking to\ndo a software business. So, you're not\ngoing to need any specific business\nlicenses for that. Okay. Now, you\nalready know how to form an LLC. That's\nthe best form of business entity you\ncould go for and I would just highly\nsuggest you to go for that. Second, I\nknow I already touched on this, but very\nimportant to go through it again.\nbusiness account matter. Business bank\naccount matters a lot because it builds\ncredit, allows you to borrow money at a\npremium in the future if you have more\ncredit. So, it's just like why you want\nto build up your personal credit with\nyour credit card. Same applies for\nbusiness. Also, Mercury would provide\nyou additional financial services if\nyou're doing really well or you're\npaying your debt on time, right? So good\nfinancial record definitely would enable\nyou to have more leverage in the future\nto leverage debt or things like that to\ndo more things with your business bank\naccount. But second of all, and I would\nsay the most important thing to have a\nbusiness bank account would be tax write\noffs. What does that mean? I'll just\nbriefly explain what tax write-offs is.\nSo every year you're going to have to\npay a self-employment tax for your LLC.\nAnd so to pay that, that tax would be\nbased off of your profit, your net\nincome.\nSo for example, if your revenue is $100\nand your business operational expense,\nyour fixed cost, variable cost,\nwhatever, add it together, your total\ncost is $50. 100 minus 50 would equals\n50. That is your net income. So, the\ngovernment would tax would base the tax\noff of that $50, which is your profit,\nright? What that means is you're\nactually missing out on tax benefits\nsince you pay less tax to the government\nif you use your business bank account to\npay for things instead of using your\npersonal bank account, right?\nLow battery.\nYeah. So,\nbasically, if you spend more as a\nbusiness, that means you could have more\ntax write-offs. That means you're\nactually going to be saving more money\nsince you're going to have to give less\nmoney as taxes to the IRS. There are\nspecific task co task codes that we\ncould go over later on, but just so you\nknow the reason why it is so important\nto have a business bank account is that\nyou have everything on paper on track\nrecord. If IRS ever were to come to you\nand be like, \"Oh, explain why why are\nyou spending this or spending that or\nwhy are you paying so so less in taxes?\"\nYou can just show them your business\nbank account transaction history and\nthey have nothing to say.\nSo again, Mercury, no monthly fees,\naccess to virtual cards, fee wire\ntransfers, designed for startups and\ntechsavvy businesses, better suited for\nbusinesses with one to five employees,\nwhich I would assume if you're watching\nthis, it's probably your case. Things\nlike that.\nLet's move on to business credit cards.\nSo in order to build credit, you need a\ncredit card. So this is basically saying\na credit card for business. So, it is\nvery important that you use your\nbusiness credit card for your expenses\nsince it builds credits and builds\nhistory, things of that nature. It's\npretty straightforward. If you have\nMercury, if you go on to the account\nsection, you're going to be able to\ngenerate and create a credit card for\nyourself. So, that wouldn't matter that\nmuch.\nGreat. So once you have the EIN, you\nhave the business legal entity\nestablished,\nyou're going to have to apply for two\nthings. One thing would be DUNS number.\nSo what is a DUNS number? It's called\ndata universal numbering system which is\na proprietary proprietary system\ndeveloped and managed by a thing called\nDNB. Basically it's a business credit\nnumber. With this number, people can\ndetermine whether your business is\ncredible or not. So why is this\nimportant? Aside from the EIN, which is\nimportant for opening a business bank\naccount, DUNS is extremely important for\nyou to apply for an Apple developer\naccount. Apple developer account\nbasically is an account that would\nenable you to publish app to the app\nstore. That's all. So once you have the\nEIN, you have the bank account, it is\nvery important for you to go right away\nto this website, the to search the UNS\non the internet and you can get started\nand usually it's free. So you fill out\nyour basic information, a bas basic\napplication\nand they're going to give you a DNS\nnumber. So based off of our personal\nexperience, we did it twice. First time\nwe got rejected because we just\nincorporated our company and apparently\nI guess they could not search the\nhistory of their database or something\nlike that and we did not get our DUNS\nnumber. Second time we paid $200\nsomething dollars for an expedited\nreview which they would guarantee I mean\nthe typical DNS free number would arrive\nin 30 days. Well, we waited too long for\nthat and we got rejected. So the second\ntime we learned our lesson. We paid $200\nsomething dollars, I think $250\nfor expedited review, which basically\nmeans that uh it only takes them at most\n7 days to review and give you a DNS\nnumber. And finally, they gave us a DNS\nnumber so that we can actually open an\napp developer account, Apple developer\naccount. So this is just really\nimportant. So a recap,\nEIN for business account and DNS for\nApple developer account. That's all.\nGreat. Also, in the DNS number\napplication, you are also going to need\na company email and company website.\nWhy? Well, DNS is a number, a serious\nnumber that represents your business\ncredibility. Well, if you don't have a\nwebsite, you don't have a business\nemail. Well, more most likely you're\ngoing to appear pretty sketchy, right?\nSo, let's figure out how you can build\nyour website. Well, uh I'm not sure\nwhether you're a developer or not. There\nare tons of webs developer development\napps out there. Wix, WordPress,\nSquarespace, countless different apps.\nIf you want us to build you uh an app\nthat would build you a website, that\nwould take us like three hours. It's\nsuper easy. So, if you need any help\nwith website, feel free to let us know.\nYou can ping us in the uh community or\njust DM us on Instagram. That'll be\ngood. But having a business account like\nfor example ours is called Boulevard\nLegacy and oh that's our Substack\nBoulevard Legacy. This is our holding\ncompany's website. So this looks really\ncredible since we are actually a company\nright and it is very credible. We see\neverything our businesses our different\napps things like that. So when the DNS\nreviewer they see our website they're\ngoing to be like this is a legit\ncompany. That's what matters the most.\nAnd also, you're going to need a an\nemail. So, our email was\ninfo@billardlegacy.com.\nWell, you can do that through a service\ncalled GoDaddy, which is you can buy a\ndomain name here, and they have a\nwebsite builder built in.\nYou type in the domain you want, you pay\nfor that domain, and they create a\nwebsite for you and email for you. You\ncan do like an add-on service for them.\nAnd yeah, you're going to have\neverything that you're going to need for\nyour DUNS number application. Also, it's\nimportant to recognize that the earlier\nyou start building your website, the\nbetter your visibility and your search\nengine results would be since you're\ngoing to be more optimized. You're going\nto be indexed to the Google search\nresults, things like that. It's more\ncredible. Again, more visibility means\nmore marketing. It's also a sales\nchannel. and customer when they use your\napp, they're gonna want to know where to\ngo to. They want to know that this app\nis being developed by a legit company,\nright? So, definitely have a company\nwebsite ready for sure.\nWell, this is pretty much the end of\nsetting up your legal business entity.\nSo, in the next chapter, I'll be talking\nabout the two most important legal\ndocuments that you're going to need for\nyour own mobile app, which is privacy\npolicy and terms and condition. I'll go\nover how to draft them and how do you\nactually make sure that it is 100%\nlegally correct. Though, I'm not a legal\nprofessional. We have not yet gotten\nsued by anyone yet. And I think we're\ndoing a pretty good job for those\npapers. And yeah, I'll see you in the\nnext chapter. Hi guys. So, welcome to\nthe privacy policy drafting session of\nthis chapter. And we're going to go over\nwhat is a privacy policy and everything\nthat you're going to need to know about\nit. So, privacy policy in short is one\nof the legal documents that you would\nneed to submit and include in your app\nwhen you're submitting it to App Store\nor when you're publicly pushing out your\napp. Basically, privacy policy, as you\nmight know, it's a paper that details\nhow you as an entity collects,\nprocesses, and uses personal\ninformation. And they're required by\nprivacy laws and must include specific\ndetails. Must also be easy to find and\nread, and you must keep it up to date\nand accurate. So, what does that mean?\nWell, in your app, there has to be a\nlink to your privacy policy, and people\nwould have to agree to both your terms\nand condition and privacy policy in\norder for them to use your app. This is\nbasically a consent to you accessing\ntheir data.\nSo, yeah, it's very I would say it's\npretty straightforward in terms of what\nyou need to know about privacy policy.\nHowever, this is a legal document and we\nhave to be really cautious since\nanything that you miss out on on the\nprivacy policy could be used against you\nif a user were to ever, you know, be\nunsatisfied with your app and they\ndecide to sue you and there that's going\nto be a lot of trouble for your\nbusiness. So having a solid privacy\npolicy is extremely important for your\nbusiness starting out. And is also very\nimportant for you to know that terms and\ncondition and privacy policy, they're\ndifferent. So privacy policy is probably\nlike the first video that you're going\nto be watching and the second video will\nbe terms and condition. Terms and\nconditions are rules of use, dispute\nresolutions, and payment terms. So if\nyou want to charge someone legally\nspeaking, you have to include it in your\nterms so that people would agree to your\nterms. It's like a contractual obl\nobligation sort of and that includes a\nlot of more stuff than simply collecting\ndata, right? So we were going to touch\non terms a lot more later on.\nIt serves as more as a disclaimer of\nliability so that when people sue you,\nyou could be like, \"Oh, wait, but they\nagreed to my terms, so you can't sue me\nsince you already agreed. You signed a\ncontract implied consent by using our\nour service.\" Things like that is\nTermly, which is the website I'm using\nright now, is a very good and widely\nused privacy policy generator. And I\nwould take you through the process of\ndrafting a privacy policy. And I\nactually have right here with me one of\nmy apps height GPT's privacy policy. And\nit is actually quite complicated as you\ncan see 20 22 pages.\nSo there's a lot to go through here.\nPlease make sure you watch all of this\nchapter so that you don't get yourself\nin any legal dispute. It is better to\nunderstand privacy policy earlier and\nlearn and avoid mistakes than to pay the\nprice of being sued.\nSo a few things to know. Privacy policy\nis very complicated due to the fact that\nyou're collecting data from people in\ndifferent parts of the world and there\nare different agreements between\ncountries that are set in place so that\ndata are protected for their own\ncitizens. Right? So one of the most\ngeneral privacy policy agreements out\nthere is called the general data\nprotection regulation GDPR.\nAnd it basically outlines everything\nthat you have to disclose in your\nprivacy policy. And there are also other\nlegal things like data protection act,\nCalifornia consumer privacy act,\nCalifornia online privacy protection\nact, things like that depending on your\nstate.\nAnd basically\nall you have to know is that you have to\nhave a privacy policy that covers\neverything\nevery agreements out there for different\ncountries so that you're well protected.\nSo we can go about and generate a\nprivacy policy here and I'll take you\nthrough step by step how you actually do\nthat. Okay. So now we have a privacy\npolicy generator portal here open.\nSo I'll say you know assuming you're\nbuilding an app mobile application\nand I would say height GPT since that is\nour second app which is an app that\nhelps predict and maximize your height.\nI go with American English.\nI would also include a description. So\nyou type in your description here. Hi\nGBT things like that. Do you have users\nin the US? Yes. Users in the EU, UK,\nSwitzerland, Iceland? Yes. Because why\nnot include more things? User in in\nCanada? Yes. The reason why they're\nasking you this is because for these\ndifferent countries, they have different\nstandard for privacy policy. So, if you\njust include every single country out\nthere, it's going to be a lot easier for\nyou to avoid legal lawsuits in the\nfuture. Since when you push your app,\nit's likely that it's going to be pushed\nto 120 something countries on app store\nand also play store. So definitely you\nwant to include everything. Can users\ncreate an account or register with your\nwebsite or app? Yes. And how would you\nlike to instruct users to update or\ndelete their accounts? So this is very\nimportant because for both our first\napparel\nwe have to have an option to enable\nusers to delete their account. Why is\nthat important? Since if users don't\nwant their data to remain on our app\ndatabase, right, they have to have a way\nto do so. That is data protection for\nthe consumer. So definitely you have to\nlist it here. The way that you're going\nto include the deletion of account\nsession,\ndo you target users under the age of 18?\nIf you say yes,\ndefinitely since if you're engaging with\nminors, that's going to be a whole\ndifferent story. If you're saying no,\nthen you have like less\nlegal obligations, things that you're\ngoing to include in privacy policy. I\nwould highly discourage choosing no\nbecause you never know whether you have\na user under 18, right? It's just better\nto include everyone in general.\nHere you select all the personal\ninformation information that you're\nplanning to correct collect directly\nfrom the user for HGBT because we need\nto collect data biometrical data like\nheight your sleep habits things like\nthat that includes a lot more things\nthan what we have right here but that\nyeah so it would be cate categorized\nunder sensitive information\nhealth data biometric data genetic data\nrace we also ask about race in high GPT\nbecause that impacts your height. So\nthese are going to make it more\ncomplicated. And when you're also\nsubmitting to App Store and Google Play\nStore, there are going to be sections in\nwhich you have to fill out specifically\nbasically disclaiming that yes,\ndisclosing that yes, you're collecting\nhealth data, genetic data, biometric\ndata, and they're very sensitive about\nthings like that. But if your app\nhappens to not collect any of those,\nthen you're very lucky. You probably\navoid quite a lot of hassle with app\nsubmission.\nCan user register your website or app\nusing Facebook, Google or other social\nmedia accounts? Yes, we usually for\nauthentication we do Gmail login or\nFacebook and Apple ID. We'll be\ncollecting any derivative data from your\nusers. We are doing that since we want\nto analyze what our users behaviors are\non the including conversion or you know\nretention rate on each page. It is best\nif you collect derivative data from\nhere. So log usage data device data\nlocation data. I would not like to add\nmy own category. Moving on would be\nrequesting access to your user geol\nlocations. For me it's no, but basically\nfelt things that that are specifically\ntailored to your needs. We were not\nusing API services.\nAre you collecting personal information\nabout your user from other sources? No.\nIf yes, fill in yes. Okay. This is the\ninteresting part. So, right now we\nfinished the US part and we're going\ninto the European part. You just have to\nmake sure you go through everything\nhere. Things like that. It really\ndepends on your specific circumstance\nwith your app. If you have any\nquestions, feel free to shoot me a DM on\non school or Instagram. I'm happy to\nhelp out. Things like Okay. So, also\nvery important thing to note, there's\nthere has to be a reasoning behind all\nthe data you collect. And in this\nsection they would ask you why you are\ncollecting the user information. For\nexample, we want to predict the user\nheight in high GPT. So therefore it is\nessential to our app's functionality to\ncollect user data. Right? So that that\nis one of the reasons why we would do\nthat. Send marketing promotional. It's\nbetter to say no. If yes, sure. But\nyou're going to have to fill out a lot\nmore stuff. So just go through\neverything here. And it really depends\non your individ as I said individual\ncircumstance. So I won't go through\neverything\nthings like that and there are a lot of\ndifferent things that you have to look\nover for example DPO it really depends\nright so again if you have any questions\nfeel free to ask me but this entire\nthing took me around 20 minutes to fill\nout and finish as an amateur to law when\nI was uh making a privacy policy for\npillar which is our first app as I\nmentioned and after this they're going I\ngenerate an entire privacy policy for\nyou hosted on Termly and it is totally\nfree for your account.\nNow, this is our privacy policy and it\nis a lot different from what you just\nsaw because we hired a legal attorney in\nNew York City to go over everything with\nus. The thing with online service is\nthat sure these software it might be\ncheap, might be efficient and a lot of\nuh different apps actually use that. For\nexample, um I'm not sure whether you\nguys heard of Cali uh the founder Blake\nhe he published a new app uh I remember\ncalled Mindset from his Apex Inc.\ncompany. And Apex's app is using I'm\npretty sure let me see I think it's Apex\nthey yeah mindset so\ntheir app is actually using oh not\navailable my bad okay but their app is\nactually using termly so and he has\npublished three apps in the past making\nmillions of dollars within a few months\nso definitely I would say there's a I\nmean there's reason why they're using\nit. But if you really want to be sure in\nwhich that was my case that we are not\ngoing to get sued and we're going to be\nlegally protected to the best extent\npossible,\ndefinitely consult with a legal\nattorney. So, how much is it to consult\nwith a legal attorney? Well, there are\ntwo ways you can go about this. First,\nyou find a guy on Fiverr or Upwork legal\nconsultation advice or a lawyer reviewer\nfor your privacy policy and terms and\ncondition. There are a bunch of lawyers\nout there who would do the freelance\nwork of reviewing your privacy policy\nand terms and condition. And it would\nusually cost around $300 to $400 for\nthat. Or you can go with the more pricey\noption where you contact specific\nbusiness legal consulting firms. They\nwould kindly draft up your privacy\npolicy for around $1,000 to 100,000\n$1,500\nand that would be another additional\n$1,000 or $2,000 for terms and condition\nto draft everything from the ground up.\nSo, I'm fortunate enough to have a legal\nattorney to go through every single\nclause on our privacy policy and terms\nand condition to ensure that it best\nfits the circumstance of our app.\nThere's no onesizefititall\nsort of uh privacy policy or terms and\ncondition. However, I would say if you\nwere to be pursuing an app that has a\nsimilar competitor out there, a really\ngood way would be to base your privacy\npolicy off of your competitors and\nrephrasing it and just double-checking\nwhether you collect more information or\nless information, adjust it, and then\nyou're probably better off just going on\nFiverr, finding a a random lawyer for\n$300\nand call about a day. This is by no\nmeans any legal advice. These are just\npotential ways that you can go about\nyour legal documents. For all legal\nadvice, please go to an actual law firm,\nlicensed law firm, licensed lawyer,\nthings like that. I'm not a legal\nprofessional. I'm just a student. But\nthis is how I did it.\nSo just so you guys can see what a\nprivacy policy would actually look like,\nthe first section would be defining the\ndifferent parties involved, right? Uh\nBoulevard Legacy would be refer to we as\nwe us and our and GPT is the app and the\nservice is something that they have to\nagree to and the things that we're\nproviding them right. So just defining\nall the terms up front and what\ninformation that we're going to be\ncollecting things like that and we're\ngoing to have a table of contents what\ninformation do we collect how do you\nprocess your information you have to\nclaim you basically have to disclose\nevery single thing on your app and\ndefinitely don't worry about this I will\nput everything our privacy policy and\nterms and condition in our course\nmaterial so that you could go over it\nsee we collect a lot of different things\nso listing out here definitely helps.\nAnd yeah, basically it looks like this.\nAgain, I would say honestly if you're\nnot a legal professional, which I would\nassume you are not, it's literally the\nbest to have some lawyer go over it. So\ndefinitely save up a bit of money, but\nit is also important for you to know the\nstructure of privacy policy.\nAnd yeah, basically it looks like this.\nAgain, if you have any more questions,\nfeel free to ask me. And uh yeah, this\nis the privacy policy section. Use\ntermly to draft up your basic foundation\nfor your privacy policy. Maybe go look\nfor a lawyer on Fiverr, reaffirm it, and\nthen you can publish it. When you're\nactually publishing the privacy policy\nalongside with the app, it is best that\nyou host the privacy policy as a PDF in\nsomewhere as a public URL so that when\nusers click on the privacy policy button\non your app or your website, it leads\ndirect them. It literally direct them to\nthe PDF and they could just have a\nbetter look. That'll be all. Thank you\nguys for joining and I'll see you in the\nnext one. Hello, welcome to the session\nof terms and conditions or terms of\nservice that you may call. You might\nrecall that this is one of the two legal\ndocuments that you're going to need for\nyour mobile app. One is privacy policy\nand one is terms of services. Terms of\nservices is more ambiguous, I would say,\ncompared to privacy policy. By no means\nI'm a legal professional. However, terms\nand condition basically means the terms\nthat you have to accept before using the\napp since it is a transaction. So, it is\na contractual agreement between you and\nthe consumer.\nFor example, if you were to charge a\nuser for using your app, if you have a\nweekly subscription plan or a monthly\nsubscription plan, they have to agree to\ngetting charged first, right? So that\nwould be included in the terms of\nservices.\nanything that would require the consumer\nto sacrifice their interest to any\nextent.\nuh those has to be listed in the terms\nof services and they would have to agree\nto terms of services uh that would be\nincluded in your website and your app so\nthat they agree to the contractual\nagreement quote unquote so that they\ncould use your app if they ever were to\nbe unsatisfied or unhappy about you know\nthe fact that you're charging them when\nthey agreed with your terms and services\nthey don't have any legal grants to sue\nyou and it serves has a really good\nlegal protection for you. So, having\nthem agree to your terms means you're\ngoing to have legal protection, but\nyou're going to have to have a good\nterms of services that includes\neverything and in a more ambiguous way\nwhere you include basically everything.\nThat's what I meant. So, this is our\nterms of services for our first app\ncalled Pillar. So as you can see we\ndefined the terms here where we are the\ncompany Boulevard Legacy LLC which is\nthe legal entity that we're operating as\nthe app is referred to as pillar the\nterms of services are referred to as the\nterms right so pretty straightforward I\nwould say and this is pretty legal\nstandard stuff where you have to give\nout all your information things like\nthat and then you have the table of\ncontents so I'll go through a few things\nfirst from our services what we provide\nIP rights user representation user\nregistrations there are different steps\nto the app that you have to specify like\nwhat you're getting out of the user and\nthe user would have to agree to as I\nmentioned financial transactions\npurchases and payments subscriptions\nright it's included here we describe our\nsoftware prohibited activities you can't\nyou know use our app to do anything\nillegal and there are uh specifically\nlaws about user generated contributions\ncontribution license, guidelines for\nreviews, things like that. And so, yeah,\nso it's just very complicated.\nIt is a 20page terms of services. It is\nalways better to make it include more\nthings so that even if a user were to\nsue you, if you're more ambiguous or you\ninclude everything, then they have more\nyou have more grounds for your argument.\nRight? It is used to protect you as the\nfounder as the operator rather than the\nconsumer\nand it is very professional as you can\nsee you first basically define all the\nterms and then you play around with the\nterms things like that and for example\nlike person payments we havecept app\nstore Google play store and then you\nagree to provide current complete and\naccurate purchase and account\ninformation for all purchases made via\nthe services you further agree to\npromptly update account and payment\ninformation, things like that. Here is\nthe fee changes. So, if you were to, you\nknow, change the weekly subscription\nplan from $3 to $4 and you're going to\nhave to communicate with that, like\ncommunicate with your users regarding\nthat or else it's going to be illegal,\nright? Yep. Things like this. I'll\ndefinitely include this in our course\nmaterials that you can go through every\nsingle thing. I'm not a lawyer. I can\nget I cannot give you a crash course on\nhow to write your own terms of services\nfrom scratch. What I can tell you is\nwhat we did right a lot of app founders\nI believe you already watched the\nprivacy policy part so I won't go even\ndeeper into it but a lot of people use\ntermly it's one of the best legal SAS\nproducts out there that includes every\nsingle thing that you would possibly\nneed for your terms and condition. Of\ncourse, I don't I'm not a legal\nprofessional, so it's not legal advice,\nbut I'll go through with you uh how do\nyou actually draft up a terms with\nTermly.\nFirst, again, define whether you are an\napp and you're a SAS, right?\nAnd it's best to include all the\ndifferent countries since they all have\ntheir different terms conditions. So\nit's just best to include everything\nspelled out in American English. Full\nname pillar and then platform hosted in\nthe United States hosted in any country.\nNo,\nit's best if you include a description\nfor personal personal use internal\nbusiness use. Say both. It's fine.\nYes,\nthey can definitely create account or\nelse what like what are they going to\ndo, right? Link their account to social\nmedias for sure. So let's say that\ndownloadable yes software subscription\nservice yes automatically renew yes\ndepends on your month your plans but\nmonthly annually we can be like oh\nmonthly and annually right\nyou offer a free trial no we do not\nspecifying the payments that we accept\nVisas\nAmerican Express Mastercard things like\nthat US dollars be the standard can ask\nyour refund no\nimportant sent app founders, why would\nyou want to allow for a refund if they\nagree to the terms and they agree to no\nrefunds? Why would you want to give back\ntheir money? So, no, they can't ask for\na refund. How can users cancel your\nsubscription? So, it's actually very\ninteresting. When you download an app,\nthe you have to be able to provide them\nlike a sub page in your app itself for\nthem to delete their account, right? So\nthat they can just stop getting charged\nby you. But at the same time the user\nwould also have to go to let's say play\nstore or app store go to their purchase\nhistory to cancel subscriptions. So that\nwould be an extra step which works in\nthe favor of the consumer social app\nfounder because the you know some people\nthey just forget about the fact that\nthey're subscribed to your app and\nthey'll just keep paying you without\neven using your service and without them\neven knowing and you're just going to\nget that monthly reoccurring revenue for\nyou know a good amount of time.\nSo let's continue. Prohibitive\nactivities\nsell or otherwise transfer your profile.\nYeah, basically it's to protect your\nrights. Okay. All user uploads or post\ncontent or platform. No. Submit reviews\nof products on your platform. Yes. So\nfor for what we did with Pillar and\nHGPT, basically during the onboarding\nflow, we included a basically a lot of\ndifferent questions, right? But we just\nwant to boost ratings for our app. So\ntherefore, we included like an app store\nrating popup during the onboarding\nwhere they answer like the first four\nquestions and then you have this popup\nsaying can you rate us five stars on the\napp store and they usually do so it\nboosts your rating up. This is a very\nstandard practice used by consumer app\nfounders across across the horizon of\ndifferent apps. For example, UMAX\nan app that's gener generating millions\nof dollars. It's after like a few months\nof launching that went viral on social\nmedia, right? So these are very standard\npractice and definitely I would highly\nrecommend you to include the submission\nfor reviews of the products on your\nplatform so that it could boost your app\nstore rating or your play store rating.\nDoes your platform link to any other\nwebsites that you do not own? Well, yes.\nfor height GPT we cited our source for\nall the height enhancement reports that\nwe based off of our algorithm from right\nso we definitely have to site our\nsources or else it's not going to be\nscientific enough for people to believe\nthat it's actually an app that would be\nable to predict your height in any way\ntherefore yes we did link it to other\nwebsites so if you have any additional\nexternal links make sure to click yes we\ndo not have third party advertisements\nments on our platform.\nUsually I would say if there's any\ndisputes I would highly recommend\ninformal negotiations then arbitration\ncountry United States and 30 days for\nsure.\nDo you want a limited amount of your\nliability for any claims against your\nplatform? Absolutely.\nYes. limited to the amount paid by the\nuser. So that a user cannot sue you for\n$100 million for paying $3 from your\napp, right? And if a user were to get $3\nback from you, I would argue that's not\nthat much. So definitely limiting your\nown liability for sure. Also, you can't\nput just like 0.5 days here since that's\nnot how law works, right? It's you have\nto be reasonable as well.\nWe do not send SMS.\nWe do have privacy policy. You include\nthe link here. We do not. And if you\nwant, you can definitely generate one\nEULA end user license agreement. If you\nsubmit your app to App Store, they're\ngoing to generate a custom EULA for you.\nSo, you don't have to really think about\nthat.\nDefinitely United States would govern.\nAnd since we're incorporated in\nDelaware, we're going to use Delorea\nlaw. And we just fill out everything\nhere and we're good.\nVery important thing here. So for all\nthe legal terms and papers we have to\nfor example you see right here\nlast updated so that like we include a\ndate so that users know when we have\nactually updated the legal terms right\nlet's not notify our users about updates\nto our legal terms since it's going to\nbe a hassle and there's no benefit in\ndoing that and you can either call it\nterms of use terms of service terms and\ncondition effective date today and you\npublish it\nand you're going to get your own termly\nterms of services, but you have to\ncreate an account, but it's fine.\nBasically, I would still recommend you\nto either get a Fiverr lawyer to review\nevery everything on your terms or\nconsult with a law firm that specializes\nin business law or, you know, software\nlaw in general. By no means is again\nit's not legal advice that I'm providing\nyou but we did consult a law firm and we\nare able to sleep during the night\nbecause we know that we're legally\nprotected. So definitely consider that\nif you don't have enough funding. I\nwould say that's probably one of the\nbest use of your funds if you have\nlimited funding because you want to be\nmake sure making sure that you're\noperating legally. So,\nif you have any more questions, feel\nfree to DM me on Instagram or to hit us\nup in the community. We're very happy to\nhelp you. Thank you for watching and\nI'll see you in the next one. Hello\neveryone, it's Benji and in this section\nI'm going to take you over the entire\nprocess of designing an app. Designing\nan app is not just a very technical\nthing that you do. You have to think\nabout the entire user flow. What that\nmeans is you have to like reverse\nengineer things to your favor uh in\nterms of assessing the marketability of\nyour design and the user flow of your\napp so that you could produce the best\nUI possible for your app. So in this\nsection I'll go over first ideiation.\nWhat's the app that's going to go viral\nand how do you structure a viral app to\nthe point where users are willing to pay\nfor your app and they actually think\nthey're getting a value out of your app.\nstarting from ideiation which is like\nthe end result. You project your\nthoughts onto a finished product and you\nreverse engineer it. You start with the\nwireframe. You think about what's going\nto be on the main page, what's going to\nbe on the onboarding flow and the pay\nwall, things like that. You wireframe\nthe entire structure and you perfect the\nwireframe. After perfecting the\nwireframe, you can actually start with\nthe specific designs. You know what\ngradient you want on a certain button,\nthings like that. As you might know, in\nthis session, we're going to be\ndesigning a concept called life clock.\nBasically, an app that first predicts\nyour life expectancy in the day that\nyou're going to die. And then with that\nbeing the primary incentive for people\nto want to download our app, our value\nad becomes now we have all these AI\nenhanced to-do list items that could\npotentially increase your life\nexpectancy by X amount of days, X amount\nof years. So the reason for people to\nbuy is very clear. Our value proposition\nis we're going to increase your life\nexpectancy. This is an inelastic demand\nthat everyone on earth will face\ndisregarding your geographical location,\nyour gender, things like that. If people\nwant to live longer, which is the common\nsense, then there is a demand for this\napp. So hopefully you guys will enjoy\nthis section and let's begin. Hello\nguys, welcome to the ideation part for\nthe design section. So ideulating an app\nis extremely straightforward but\ncomplicated at the same time. In this\nsection, I'll I'll go over what makes a\nviral app and what goes into the reverse\nengineering of these apps. So here we\nhave a very good example of a viral\nconsumer app. Calai, I think, made\naround $14 million within a few months\nof launching. It is a very simple\nconsumer app that was pushed out by a\n17-year-old high schooler and it's\nmaking a lot of money. I think they have\nother co-founders, but that's beside the\npoint. Now, what is Calai? Calai is an\napp that allows you to take a picture of\nyour food and it's going to tell you the\ncalories behind it. That's all.\nNow, it only took me a sentence to\nexplain what Kelli does and that is the\nfirst point in building a viral app.\nClear value proposition in the app with\na very interesting twist.\nNow, this app is honestly not that hard\nto make since you can connect to an AI\nAPI. It's going to do the analysis for\nyou. For example, calories, carbs,\nprotein, fats, health score. What they\ndo is they take a picture of the food\nand then it's going to evaluate maybe on\nthe back end, oh, how much how much of\nthe food we're looking at and then they\njust go through their library. Okay,\nblueberries 1 gram equals how many\ncalories and on the back end they just\naggre aggregate all the data and compile\nit and give it to you in the optimal\ntime. And as you can see right here,\nshows the calories, protein, stuff like\nthat, right? So\na lot of people are complaining that\nKaii is not that accurate. However, it\ndoes not matter whe whether it's\naccurate or not since it's making so\nmuch money. The value propos proposition\nof the app itself is interesting enough\nto the point where people are willing to\npay some money to purchase this app just\nto try out.\nNow what can we learn from this?\nWell, the best app in the world of\ncourse requires a lot of engineering,\nright? But when you're starting with a\nconsumer app where a viral potential app\nlike an app you want to just go viral on\nsocial media and do a cash grab, this is\nthe way to go. Think about how you're\ngoing to market your idea first before\ndoing any wireframing or coding.\nThink about how it's going to be\npresented to users. How are you going to\nmarket the app? Is the value proposition\nextremely clear within the tagline of\nyour app? For example, our app our app\ncalled a high GPT extremely simple.\nPredict and maximize your height gives\nyou your current height output and\ngenerates potential height. the\nprobability of you reaching your dream\nheight and also add in a bit of\ngimmification where in there where you\nhave streaks but also you know you're\ntaller than 80% 70% of people encourages\ncompetition and continuous usage for the\napp right so think about how you're\ngoing to market the app first before\ndoing anything. So how do you find the\nright idea? Well, there's a famous quote\nthat says, \"Don't just copy, just\nsteal.\" Right? Like, find proven ideas\non the market that has like a proven\ndemand for. So, think about what you\nwould personally want to build, right?\nAnd you can check out other consumer\nsocial apps online that are going viral.\nFor example, there's another app called\nUMAX. Um is an app that allows you to\ntake a picture of yourself. again rates\nyou give you a score. Oh, you know\nyou're like like your skin is like a 91,\nyour masculinity is 82. Like what are\nthose standards? And the UI are clearly\nvery poorly designed, but it does not\nmatter. It's has generated millions of\ndollars in revenue for the founder. So\nreally the idea matters the most since\nyou're not, you know, you're not selling\nto a VC, right? you're selling to a kid\nbrowsing the internet who's willing to\nspend $2 on the app on a monthly\nsubscription or something like that.\nNow, I want to go through the\ngamification aspect of these apps. So,\nyou see how in UMAX in the get your\nrating section, they basically show you\nwhat you currently are and your\npotential. So, people will be intrigued\nto pursue the potential, right? and they\ncreated a problem in which wait you know\nas a consumer I see that there's a\nnine-point difference between my overall\nand my potential there might be\nsomething I want to do with this right\nsince the AI app is telling me that I'm\nnot the best version of myself so oh I\nalready created a demand as the app and\nthe app offers the alternative the\nsolution great just spend some money on\nour app I'll give you a custom routine\nyou can check yourself out as a 10 out\nof 10 And you can rate yourself on a\nvery frequent basis that you could keep\nand you can keep track of your scores.\nNow,\nthis app is making millions of dollars,\nright? Well, where did they find these\nalgorithms to actually evaluate people?\nWell, a lot of people would say, you\nknow, they're not accurate at all,\nright? Advertising for app and app\nquality. People get over it like, oh,\npeople get really mad over insulting\npeople, things like that. People say the\ninterface is chunky, promise features\nbarely work, the algorithm is not as\ngood as people might imagine, right?\nSince there's no algorithm that could\nlike, you know, objectively define a\nperson's look unless you're very quote\nunquote ugly, right? So, it doesn't\nmatter how good your product is, as long\nas you can ensure the basic\nfunctionality actually works and you\nhave the right marketing, it's going to\ngo viral,\nright? So for example for high GPT like\nwe actually based off of our algorithm\non like all dozens of research papers\nand potential height is actually\nsomething like that you can use like an\nequation to calculate based off of\ncertain inputs of your app. So we\nactually win in terms of accuracy but\nalso marketability. So that's why we're\ngetting a lot of users every single day\neven with just like one week of\nlaunching. Right?\nSo now you know how these apps work.\nNow there are six points I also want to\nfirst is what I just said clarity and\npsychology.\nThe purpose is extremely clear and the\nbenefits is extremely clear as well. So\nmaking your value proposition extremely\nclear. Second is purposeful onboarding.\nSo one thing to mention is with apps\nlike UMAX Cali\nthey only are payto use. So on their\nonboarding process, they ask you a\nseries of questions about you know for\nexample right like COI oh what what's\nyour goal with COI like what's your\nwhat's your weight what's your like\nwhat's your habits or with UMAX how you\nknow what do you think you are like\nyou're are you a seven now what do you\nthink about are you a seven now like do\nyou want to become a nine yes you know\nlike okay well how would pe how would\npeople talk about you well they they\nthey think I'm a five but you know I\nwant to go beyond just a type, things\nlike that. Or I can also show you our\nonboarding process for Pillar. The\nPillar Pillar app is our first product\nwhere basically we ask people a bunch of\nquestions upfront about their daily\nroutines and then we aggregate their\ndata and rate them based off of\ndifferent aspects of their life, right?\nSo we ask them, do are you satisfied\nwith your nutrition? Are you satisfied\nwith your career? Things like that. And\nthen we have a series of back-end\nalgorithm that will just generate\naggregate like a score for them and it's\nhighly customized and you know they're\nbought into the narrative. After us\nasking 20 questions on the onboarding\ninstead of them turnurning away and just\ndeleting the app people actually stayed\nall basically 90% of people stayed\nthroughout the onboarding because the\nconcept of opportunity cost is very\ninteresting. human psychology, human\npsychology, if they put in like a an x\namount of time, right, or x amount of\neffort into something, it's more likely\nthat they're not going to want to give\nup on something. If you already spent\n$5,000 on your computer setup, and\nthere's this guy who told who told you,\nactually, I can make your computer a bit\nbetter, but for the price of 2K, well,\npeople are likely going to spend that 2K\nsince they already spent the 5K. if they\nspend, you know, like 10 minutes out of\ntheir day filling out 20 questions and\nthey're expecting to see something, but\nthen they see the payw wall and be like,\n\"Oh,\" and you're going to be like, \"Oh,\nI have to pay to use this app.\" Okay,\nwell, since I already spent all that\ntime, why not I just pay for the app,\nright? So, longer onboarding with more\ncustomized problem would actually\nincrease conversion rate. That's the\nfirst thing that we can learn from KA\nIUMAX and even our own apps as well.\nAnd thirdly is they paint a very good\nvalue proposition. What does that mean?\nWell, for Cal Cali, right, they ask\nabout height and weight and you know\npeople feel more personalized as I just\nsaid, but also they visualize it with\ngraphs. I know graphs is not the best\nbut if you see some sort of\nvisualization\nand people are giving you like a\nquantitative approach to things that you\nyou normally wouldn't you normally\nwouldn't think that that would be\nquantifiable then it's a very\ninteresting selling point if I can\nvisualize how attractive I am of course\nI'm going to pay for it right at least\nin the minds of the people on the\ninternet now fourth would be showing a\npreview before sign up so there's a\ndashboard preview view where the app Cai\nbasically shows the users their\npotential. Oh, you can wait you can lose\nup to X amount of kilograms. You can you\ncan add in like h like a few kilograms\nof muscles, things like that. people are\nrewarded for completing the setup\nquestions and then so this sort of oh\nyeah I received value from answering\nquestions but at the same time there's\nmore like there's 95% more I can\nactually do stuff to improve my score\nbased off of these apps ratings you know\nthat's what get people to buy that's\nwhat increases conversion rate so you're\nbuilding momentum towards the payw wall\nthat's pretty much it and finally\naccount creation\nRight. So after all that they go through\nthe subscription things like that they\ngo they only do Apple and Google options\nsince this means that users will only\nhave to verify them via their existing\naccounts to further reduce friction.\nLike why would I spend another five\nminutes creating an account using Gmail\nwhen I can just log in with Apple, login\nwith Google, things like that. They even\neliminated that account creation method\nto reduce friction. So that's also\nsomething to keep in mind. Making the\nuser experience as smooth as possible\nwould highly highly encourage users to\nactually pay for your app.\nNow this is the case study of COAI.\nHopefully you can learn a lot from the\npsychology behind consumer social apps\nfrom this session. In the next section\nI'll go through the actual building\nprocess of the app that we're going to\nbe building life clock or at least\nthat's the name for it so far. Thank you\nand I'll see you in the next section.\nHello everyone, welcome back. Let's\nwireframe our app. So our app's concept\nis life clock. Basically an app that\npredicts when you're going to die and\ngives you ways to increase your life\nexpectancy. Now we only use Figma for\nour design process. It's basically the\nPhotoshop for software products. You can\neasily design all the user interface in\nthis software. Now\nlet's go through a case study which is\nour third product Simplexity. What is\nSimplexity? It is basically a search\ntool for you to search your network. So\nyou want to look for a video editor\nwithin your network for sure. Type in in\nthis chat GBT interface then we're going\nto get you what you want and we're going\nto get deliver the results in in this\nway. Now this is a rough draft but you\ncan see what I mean. We categorize\ndifferent areas different sections of\nthe software with this tag. So for\nexample for this this is a web app so\ndefinitely not applicable to the app\nthat we're building but the structure is\nthe same thing. We start with\nauthentication. This section is\nauthentication and create account things\nlike that. Okay this is a flow. We call\nthis a flow. So the flow for\nauthentication is like this. That's\npretty much it.\nNow uh we have a section this is a\nfunctionality where we connect users\nwith their LinkedIn, Gmail, Twitter so\nthat we can actually get the database of\ntheir people right so this is another\nflow we also specify you know click\nupload opens your computer's folder to\nselect the CSV file and then it\ngenerates the outcome so just to take\nyou through the flow you you you go here\nand then you click connect you can start\nsearching for people, things like that.\nNow, this is another flow.\nYou have also the LinkedIn comment\nscraper. Put a LinkedIn URL. It's going\nto scrape the comment for you. Business\ntemplate generator. Put in your ideas,\nyour chat history. It's going to\ngenerate idea, business plans for you\nbased off of your input. Right? These\nare different features that we have. So,\nwe divide it up to different sections.\nEven for settings, we have our own\nsettings page. So wireframing and\ndesigning an app basically involves you\nto design each screen when a user clicks\na button. So each button should have\ntheir own respective screens.\nSo often this is a very simple design,\nbut often you're going to have a much\nmore complicated wireframe and design if\nyou were to pursue something more\nambitious.\nIn our case, that's not going to be too\nmuch.\nNow let's idiate the entire app. We call\nit life life clock.\nLet's think about the functionalities we\nwant in this app. Life clock. So we\nfirst our selling point is that people\nfear death. And we solve this by\nproviding their death date. Right? Of\ncourse, we're not going to know exactly\nwhen they're going to die, but there are\nmathematical equations based off of\npeople's habits that you can assign a\nvalue to and then use those values to\nbasically generate like a mathematical\nequation to predict when they're going\nto die, right? There are research\nreports out there. Um, so it's\ndefinitely not something impossible,\nright? This is sort of theformational\ngap between people who read medical\nresearch reports and people who don't\nread medical research reports.\nYou know, typical people might think,\nwait, how can you predict someone's\ndeath date? Well, that's I that's\ndefinitely not a viable idea. So,\ntherefore, I'm not going to go for it.\nNow, accuracy does not matter that much.\nOf course, you want to be within, you\nknow, like 95% of accuracy, but no one's\ngoing to be like like when they be like,\n\"Oh, wait. My life expectancy is\nactually, you know, it's actually 95\ninstead of 93 or something like that.\"\nAll right? They're not going to do that.\nOf course, you have to be accurate,\nthough. So the algorithm should be based\noff of real medical research reports\nwith real standings.\nNow this is our value proposition. We\nprovide people their death date. So we\ncreate a problem here, right? We create\na demand and a problem. Now when you\ncreate a demand and a problem, this is\nnot something new, right? Like people\nfear death. We're just productizing and\nmaking it more obvious to them that\nthere's a demand. Nobody thinks about,\noh wait, I'm going to die in 50 years or\n60 years on a daily basis, right? But if\nthey're using your app, you want to make\nthem think that. And you created this\nfear of death and then you're here\noffering them an alternative, a\nsolution. So you created this demand.\nThis is our selling point. This is\nextremely clear. Why do I why do I ch\nthis choose this? Right? Big market\nsize. Also, if you think about the\nmarketing aspect, which we are\ndefinitely going to get more into in\nlater on sections in the scaling\nsection, but if you think about how we\ncan market this app, like you have all\nthese different ideas, right? You can do\ninfluencers, content creators, you can\ndo slideshows, you can utilize people's\nfear and profit off of it. For example,\nslideshow saying the average human life\nexpectancy is 82 years old. you are 30\nright now, meaning you have x amount of\ndays left,\nright? There are different ways you can\nproductize on those. And also, you've\ndefinitely seen those soldiers returning\nto home videos online where people are\nlike just very emotionally impacted by\nthose videos. But definitely something\nthat plays around with, you know, losing\nyour family, losing your friend, losing\nyour loved ones or oh, I don't want to\ndie. I want to live to the point where I\ncan see my grandkids come out. Like\nthere are a lot of different plays you\ncan do on this. So definitely the\nmarketing is something we can explore\nfurther.\nEven just displaying the app itself like\nwhat KAI did what their advertisement is\nbasically users using their app and the\napp user flow itself is a good marketing\ntool because it's interesting enough and\nthe value ad is simple and clear.\nSo we can also show people just using an\napp that predicts their death time. like\npeople are going to be intrigued by that\nand it's going to spark a demand in\nthem, right? So, we have a big market\nsize and the conversion on this is\ndefinitely going to be high since we're\nplaying on fear. You know, if you profit\noff of anything that people want the\nmost, you teach people how to be rich,\nyou teach people how to get girls, how\nto get sex, you teach people anything\nabout health, like these are inelastic\ndemands that people would ultimately\nwant, right? like there's nobody that\ndoes not want more money, does not want\nto be attractive, does not want to be,\nyou know, live longer, things like that,\nright? So, we're profiting off of a huge\ndemand here now. So, this is why we're\npursuing this idea. Okay. Now, we\nvalidated the idea, right? Validated the\nidea.\nThen, we have to think about the\nexecution of the idea. Now, what's going\nto happen? Well, the app structure is\ngoing to be like this. So we have\nonboarding flow. Basically ask questions\nabout death and also their routines.\nSince the reason why people would\nactually want to buy an app that\npredicts their high predicts their death\ndate is because it's based off of their\ndata, right? So it's customized like a\ncustomiz customized results. Nobody want\nto care. Nobody cares about what other\npeople's death date is. So if that's\nyour selling point, you're not going to\nsell. if I know about my own death date\nthat's the most important thing so\nonboarding flow you have to ask\nquestions about death and their routines\nso the main reason for doing this is so\nthat we can actually aggregate enough\ndata and also at the same time gradually\nlure them in since it's basically like a\nsalesperson saying do you need this do\nyou ever think earlier do you ever think\nabout you need this you need that you\nwant to improve your life okay then buy\nour product right things like that but\nit's just another more nonforcy way to\nget users to buy into your narrative\nnarrative.\nSo on boarding flow and then of my bad\nfirst thing first is definitely\nauthentication. So create account. So\nthis is the typical page you see like\nsign in with Apple or Google which is\nvery simple authentication and then you\nhave onboarding flow. After onboarding\nflow you hit them with a hard payw wall.\nNow there are a lot of cases to be made\nto be against fremium model. But the\nreason why also I have another video\ntalking about why we should choose hard\npayw wall is because the conversion on\nthat is going to be much better than a\nfremium model since in short a premium\nmodel like the additional additional\nvalue you provide in addition to the\nfree features would have to justify the\npricing which oftentimes you cannot do\nwith a single use case app.\nIf you're already providing three\nfunctionalities out of five for people\nfor for people to use for free, what\nincentive are there for them ex you know\nfor for the next two paid features?\nYou're either going to have to charge\nextremely low or nobody's going to\nactually pay for it. So definitely a\nhard pay wall pay to use payw wall for\nsure.\nAfter payw wall you actually get into\nthe main page. Well, the main page I\nwould say for a a product like life\nclock, we're playing around with the\nconcept of time, right? So, main page,\nwe should probably include time, time\nleft.\nAnd since our value ad is things they\ncould do to improve their life and their\nlife expectancy, to-do list items.\nAlso, we can add in some gamification\naspect, streaks,\nmedals. It's on the side type of thing.\nI like to show you pillar pillar app. So\nour product is like this. We have pillar\nscore which is the aggregated score of\ntheir self-improvement score. Basically\nalso streaks and gamifying the entire\naspect of self-improvement. Also to-do\nlist to-do list items things that\nactually get the users to use in the\napp. Right? You need a use case for your\napp. Therefore to-do list items is a\nreally good way to do so. you know add\nin streaks medals um incentive structure\nbasically\nI'm really bad at typing incentive\nstructure also could include some comp\ncompetition element so rankings among\nlocal people or whatever could talk\nthink more about that later so this is\nthe main page\nwell thinking of this since our value ad\nis the to-do list items right like\nprediction of time is what gets them to\nbuy our value ad is to-do list items.\nSo, we should definitely have a to-do\nlist page where they can choose\nwhat they want. So, we can categorize\nmaybe like increase in life expectancy\ninto different categories, right?\nInto like nutrition,\nexercise, different areas. Not sure.\nWe're going to talk more about the\ncategories later. Choose what they want\ncategories. That's so far what I have in\nmind. Okay. Then we have the\nI think we should add in an AI feature\nAI chatbot\nchatbot like your life coach chatbot to\nanswer your questions so you could you\nknow sell as like an AI enhanced app\nright clock is not just life clock\nanymore it's life life clock enhanced by\nAI and there's a reason why majority of\nthe startups right now are all doing AI\nstuff and VCs are funding them is\nbecause AI is hot and you should\ndefinitely put AI into your your app.\nAnd adding AI is extremely simple. Just\nconnect an API key with open AI like\nchatbd.\nYou can put chbd into your app in less\nthan like 20 minutes which Gabriel will\nshow you. So AI is really not that hard.\nNow what else should we add?\nWe can also add in a page with\ncredibility, right? So, user feedback,\nthings like that. We can think more\nabout that later.\nWe should definitely for the main page,\nit's definitely not going to have enough\nspace like pillar to display the like\nyour life expectancy graph, right? So,\nwe definitely need another page\nlife\nexpectancy graph. So it's just like a\nstock chart basically stock chart that\ndisplays\ndisplays real life like imagine you can\nstockify your life expectancy that's\ngoing to be a very interesting user\nexperience stocks chart and definitely\nwe should think about more later maybe\ndifferent subcategories\nbeing being visualized some somehow\nall right things like that so we have\nmain page to-do list to-do list page AI\nlife expectancy graph. That's pretty\nmuch it for I would say the entire app.\nNow we can we should and we can go deep\ninto each section. So from now on all\nthe videos are going to be categorized\nlike authentication is going to be one\nvideo, onboarding flow is going to be\none video, hard payable is going to be\none video and yeah this is pretty much\nthe structure we have right now for life\nclock. I will see you in the next\nsection for authentication. Hello\neveryone. Now we are wireframing life\nclock. So the first thing you do is you\nuse the square button here and you write\nup the you you create the space for the\nfirst flow. Now we have a few flows that\nwe previously discussed which I'll show\nyou right here. We're going to begin\nwith authentication which is the first\npage and the first flow that the user is\ngoing to experience which is login with\nApple or Google. Right? So this section\nis authentication. Now I'm going to\nteach you how I organize things. So as\nyou can see with simplexity which I just\nshowed you in the last section, we\nbasically use a flow square. This is the\nsquare in which we're going to put all\nour screenshots in. Now let's name this.\nSo authentication.\nSo this is fairly simple so that it's\njust better visually speaking when we\nlook back and when we start coding the\napp. Now let's create another let's\ncreate a frame. So let's create a frame\nright here. Press on F and you can\ncreate a frame. This is the first screen\nof the app. Now I'm thinking since this\nis since this is a wireframe, right? So\nnothing big. I would put on a clock\nactually right here. Probably like this.\nThis should be a clock and doing like a\ncountdown thing. And in this section\ndefinitely like sign sign in with\nGoogle, sign in with Apple, right? So\njust to make it very clear what we want\nthe location of each button to be in, we\nshould definitely label it. So\nauthentication\nI'll say sign in Google and make it\nsmaller. So when you want to adjust and\nyou can adjust it. So I adjust this.\nSign in Google. Sign in Apple.\nThis is pretty much the idea that we\nwant right now. I'm thinking once the\nuser get here, right, we're going to\nneed a I think something that is\nvisually appealing. So, except for the\nclock, I think we can also consider\ndoing something here. There's a space\nhere to make it easier. Maybe like\nanother timer or another something like\nwe can think about that later. So, Ctrl\nC. I copy this. I move it here. This is\ngoing to be the life clock.\nGreat. This is our first page of our\nwireframe.\nNow I'll just copy and paste this. This\nis going to be the second page. So what\ncomes after this? Well, people either\nsign in with Google or sign in with\nApple. Well, the page with that would be\ndisplayed later on, which we should not\nbe designing right now because if you\nsign in with Apple, there's going to be\na popup later on when you code the\nactual app. Uh, you know, it's going to\nbe a very standard thing that Apple does\nwith their apps. So, we're not going to\ndo sign in with Apple design since it's\nalready a default option. we we can't\nchange the design for users to sign in\nwith Apple. Same with sign in with\nGoogle since you have to they they\nbasically redirect you to the Gmail page\nin which you have to sign in. So\ntherefore there's no need in designing\nyou know both the the respective pages\nwith um with these buttons and we should\njust move on to the second page and yep\nyou can create more frames things like\nthat. Now, authentication is basically\nthis.\nI would say this is pretty much it for\nthe first page. And then what is the\nthing that they're going to see after\nafter after signing in? Well, they're\ngoing to have to see something\ncaptivating, right? So, I think it's\nnice for us to begin with the\nonboarding.\nOkay. Now, these are the questions I\nhave for the onboarding flow. Since\nauthentication, we pretty much finished.\nI kind of created quite a long frame for\nit, but it's fine. I'll just put it like\nthis. Authentication.\nI'll move everything. Copy. Paste. Down\nhere. We have onboarding questions.\nOops.\nWe have on on boarding. Onboarding\nquestions. So, this is the part where\nyou get them to\nwant to use the app, right? So, this is\nwhere you start asking questions. Now,\nhow do you ask questions? It's very\nsimple. You just ask them and you\nprovide them with a few options. So,\nwith all the viral consumer social apps\nout there, you know, apps like Twitter,\nUMAX,\nCalai, they all use a very simple four\noption, three option button.\nSo, they only do this and they ask their\nquestion right here. So let me move this\nright here.\nSo here would be the question,\nthe big question.\nAnd then answer one,\nanswer one,\nanswer two,\nanswer three.\nThat's all. Now what are we trying to do\nhere? As I stated before, first is to\nget them to be invested in the app.\nPeople often buy when they feel like\nthey have already given a certain cost\nin in terms of time, right? Since they\nhave to fill out these questions and\nthese answers would allow us to\ncustomize the user experience according\nthese answer. We're going to assign a\nvalue in the back end and we're going to\naggregate an equation to basically uh\ndifferent answers and different\nquestions definitely have different\nwaitings. So uh I will talk about the\nbackend logic. When the user press this\nbutton, it's going to correspond with a\nvalue on the back end and using those\nvalues from the back end, you can\ncustomize basically the user experience\nfor the user. Now, what are the\nquestions? Right, I came up with a few.\nSo, how do we determine someone would\ndie early or die later? These are the\ndefinitely um the variables to take into\naccount of that just brainstormed. age,\nrace, male, like your gender really\nmatters a lot in terms of your life\nexpectancy, your weight of course, blood\npressure, whether you have any disease,\nyou know, name, of course, we're going\nto give optionalities in terms of\ndisease. Maybe we're going to be more\nspecific, you know, heart disease,\nthings like that, whether you have\ncancer, your name should probably be in\nfront probably here. You ask about their\nname so you can customize the experience\nfor them. Even here, vegetable intake,\nyou know, vegetables really help you.\nfast food. Do you eat fast food? Do you\neat sugar? What are you drinking enough\nof water? Exercise very like sleep,\nsleep quality, relationship status.\nThese are all the things that would\nimpact your life expectancy. So for each\nof these questions, we're going to\nassign a value, right? So for example,\nif you're for for your age, right,\nyou're going to be like 18 to 25 and 26\nto 30 to something like that, right?\nYou're going to give different\noptionalities. race, well, Asian, white,\nHispanic,\nthings like that. Male, well, gender,\nvery straightforward. Male, female,\nweight. You do different categories. K,\nkg to 60 kg, 61 to 70 kg,\nup up. Blood pressure, we do that. Fast\nfood freak. Well, in terms of fast food,\nwe're going to be like, oh, one once a\nweek and twice a week,\nthree times\na week. These are going to be the\nquestions, right? So, how do we actually\ndo this? Let's It's going to be a pretty\nmundane and boring process,\njust so you guys know. Let me let me\njust go through it. First is name,\nright? Okay. Name. Well, for this you're\njust going to be like name and then\nthere's an input box. Just one. That's\nall. It's gonna ask her your name.\nWhat's your name? I put it in. First\nquestion.\nWell, let's do fast food. It doesn't\nmatter the recency, things like that. Of\ncourse, we're going to start off with\nage, race, male, weight, blood pressure.\nSure. We can just start with age, right?\nQuestion.\nWhat is your age right now?\nThis is going to be the first question\nthat makes him want to that makes them\ngo through the onboarding. What is your\nquestion right now? What is your age\nright now? Well, the first thing would\nbe 18 to\n25. Now, we are in the idea phase,\nright? So, perfection is not necessary.\nThere might be a better way to\ncategorize age, but not that I know of\nright now. So,\n26 to 32 35\nor 36 to\n40 45.\nOh, you might need we might even need\nmore. So,\nanother button.\nIt's very rough. It does not matter at\nall. And then we're going to basically\ndo this entire thing for the however\nor how however many questions we have. 1\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n27 questions. That's a very long\nonboarding process which I would argue\nit's very good since there's a big\nopportunity cost for people to be doing\nthis and that is good for us since they\nare investing their time they're going\nto spend to make sure their time is not\nwasted spend money right so we're going\nto do this for each wireframe\nand we're going to do this for let's\njust have the structure ready it's 27 So\nvery clear, the onboarding is a series\nof buttons that you're going to have to\npress for different questions. Now, I'm\nnot going to go into the specific\ndrafting details of my questions because\nyou're not going to be building a life\nclock and that would be more specific\ntowards the example and I wouldn't see a\nnecessary value in you going through all\nthe questions with me, right? Like\nyou're here to learn how to build an\napp. So just so you know, we have the\nquestions right here. Here we're going\nto list out the different options and\nthen later on we're going to assign a\nvalue well a value to these so that they\ncould actually aggregate a correct data\naccording to the options. So again\nthat's going to be in another video but\njust so you know we have 27 screens 27\npages we have to do out of these 27\nquestions. So that would be the entirety\nof onboarding questions.\nNow after onboarding what do we do? We\nhit them with the payw wall onboarding\nflow.\nWe hit them with the payw wall. So I'll\nsee you in the next one. Bye-bye.\nWelcome back to the wireframing session\nand right now we will be designing the\npayw wall. the the payw wall is\nextremely important as it is the one of\nthe most important thing for converting\nuh users to paying users. So we're going\nto create another flow. We're going to\nname name it payw wall.\nNow we're going to have to do a lot of\ndifferent payw wall studies. And there\nare a few ways you can go about doing a\npayw wall. So some people most most apps\nthey do monthly and annual\nthere also some apps that do weekly and\nweekly and lifetime.\nSo it really depends on I guess the way\nyou want to go about things. There are a\nlot of different arguments and apps that\nare doing extremely well with both paid\nwall versions. So usually what people do\nwith monthly is that for example they\ncharge $5 per month and for annual\nsupposedly 5 * 12 equals 60 but they\nonly charge 49 or something like that\nright so that is definitely one thing or\nthe other strategy that people use would\nbe weekly and lifetime weekly you know\nyou might have to pay $3.99\nfor a week but for lifetime you only\nhave to pay $19.99\nAnd\nso definitely that's also another way to\nshowcase actually maybe lifetime is the\nbest idea, right? It's also really\nimportant to realize that monthly\nreoccurring revenue and lifetime access\nwhich is a oneet one-time payment. They\neach all have their own benefits. For\nexample, lifetime you don't have to\nworry about users churning, right? If\nyou have monthly users, they might churn\naway. They might unsubscribe on the\nthird month. But with a lifetime\nsubscription, you can ensure that the\nlife span of the user would be maximized\nin which you're, you know, you're\nextracting enough money from each user.\nAnd so also some people might do, you\nknow, 30% off on monthly, weekly, or oh,\n5day trial, three-day trial, right? So,\nand hopefully the users would like their\napp. Now, it really depends on your\ncircumstance. I believe in a life clock\nor whatever name we're going to call it.\nAnd so I will go with monthly and annual\nfor at least for the wireframe design\nfor now. So how do we do the wireframe?\nWell, how do we do the wireframe for the\npayw wall? Well, on the on the pay wall,\nyou definitely have to mention a few\nthings. You have to remind the user your\nvalue ad, why they want like why they\nshould pay you money.\nSo, um the these are going to be the\nsections in which you you're going to\ncharge them. Um\nyou know, for example, monthly, let's\njust say 3.99. Right now, we're going to\nhave a section talking about how to\nprice your app, but we're just doing\nplaceholders for now. Annual, let's do,\nyou know, who knows, $39.99.\nAnd at the end you have to have a bit of\nterms\nterms apply\nthings like that legal stuff you have to\nput in and you also need to give them a\nway out right so like a X button\nsomewhere somewhere here\nand there's a strategy that people often\nuse which is if users click away from\nthe pay wall and they're not they\ndecided not to pay and they click on the\nX right here Then\nyou know they actually give them a\ndiscount.\nActually give them a discount of prices.\nYeah. Basically something like this. So\nthey click on it and there's going to be\na popup that potentially says, \"Oh,\nactually, oh, I'll give you 50% off, but\nyou have to pay, right?\" So that's also\nanother good way to avoid users\nturnurning.\nSo, you're going to have a popup and a\nnew a new option that goes new option\nthat basically goes Oh, now we're\ndecreasing the price from\nmy bad that we're decreasing the price.\nSomething like that. And now you're\ngoing to have to have a good visual. So,\na good visual would include two things.\nFirst, credentials. second graphics. So\nmaybe we're going to put another death\nclock or a visual just something\nsomething attractive visually appealing\nhere. And here we put our credentials.\nWe can say we on average increase or oh\nI think there's a good marketing ad\nwhere we can we can say increased\na lot of years\nof life for people right that's a very\nvery intriguing thing since our value ad\nis increasing life this is a very good\nsocial proof but also we can add in oh\nnumber one app in xxx or something right\nyou can you can think about what you\nwant to\nBut these are the value ad reminding\npeople that you know if you buy this\nthat equals to more life for you. So\nit's it's going to be phrase it as you\nknow $4 you're going to buy your life\nback things like that. I wouldn't focus\ntoo much on this since this is a very\nspecific example right but yeah this is\nthe payw wall reasoning you can do\nmonthly annual or weekly lifetime. And\nwhen users click on the X, they want to\nexit out of the payw wall, then they\neither go back to the um they either go\nback to the onboarding question last\nscreen or they're just stuck here and\nthey can't get past this like a hard pay\nwall, which is what we did for high GPT\nand pillar. That also works. Depends on\nyour tolerance level and what your app\nis, right?\nThat is it for payw wall. Thank you for\nwatching and I'll see you in the next\none. Hello everyone. Welcome back to the\nwireframing of the app. Now we are going\nto be designing the main page. For the\nmain page, we have the time left to do\nlist items and streaks. It is extremely\nimportant for you to incorporate streaks\nand just any gamification on the main\npage so that user retention rate could\nincrease. The more time the user would\nspend on your app, the more successful\nyou are as an app founder. If they need\nyour app more, they're going to most\nlikely stick around with your app and\npay you monthly or annually. Okay. So,\nour main our whole selling point is time\nleft, right? So, if you have a big\nselling point, that is what you have to\ndo to make it um to make it like the\nmain thing on your main page.\nSo, main page, we should first talk\nabout the navigation bar.\nNavigation bar is the basically the\ndifferent buttons that you're going to\nsee below. We're going to have the main\npage button here and we have a lot more\nother pages, right? We have to-do list\npage AI graph page. So we have in total\nfour pages. So it's just going to be\nlike something like this. This four\npages\nand\nmain page we want to do to-do list\nitems. Let's do time left first. I think\nalso one good thing that we can\nincorporate is widget. So imagine a\nwidget that displays how much time you\nhave left based on you know maybe a week\nbasis or a month basis or your life\nbasis and it it's like a graph. It's\nlike a widget where it shows you know\nhow much time you have left as like a\nvery big fat number just right there.\njust right there sort of oops\njust something like a big big fat number\njust sitting right there and it's just\ncounting down on the widget that is also\na great marketing tactic that you could\nuse to increase user retention. I just\nthought of it. So widget definitely life\nex expectancy based on month\nand year in your entire life. And you\ncan add gamification by adding whether\nyou decrease\nor increase your life. Right?\nAnd that is very interesting since\nnegative shock. If people see wait my\nlife is my life expectancy is shortening\nthat gives them an urge to use your app.\nRight? Because your a value ad again\nonce again it's tied to people's desire\nto live longer.\nOkay. Time left. Let's design something\nlike a main clock, right? Like a like a\nclock where it shows how much time you\nhave left. I would say it's like a small\npreview. I would do like a small preview\nof the graph page. So I'll put something\nhere. Something maybe we can do a graph.\nWe can do something like that. You know,\njust let's just think of something,\nright? Potentially a graph of your life\nvisualization. Not sure. And to-do list\nitems can be something like this. So,\nyou just roughly draft out each section.\nAnd\nsince is it is a to-do list item, you\ndefinitely need to be able to check it\noff. Um,\ngive me a sec.\nOops.\nSo, you're going to have the\ncheck box like this.\nI'm just part of the ideation process.\nWe do this for every single\nOops. Yeah, we can do this for every\nsingle\npart. Just a very rough just throwing\nideas. Remember, this is the time to get\ncreative. So, this could be the rough\nstructure. Main page. Great. We should\nnot even call this main page. Let's just\ngo let's just do all pages. And this is\ndefinitely the main page.\nMain page looks like something like\nthis. And there should be like a scroll\nbar where some goes something like this.\nAnd when you scroll this ch this part\nchanges accordingly. So you can scroll\ninfinitely. So maybe you have 10 to-do\nlist items that you have to do. Then you\nscroll through it on the main page and\nensure you you do each one. I would also\nsay we want to add in gamification,\nright? So we added time left. So\nthat's great. And\nright now we have to-do list items which\nwe did as well. Streaks. So how do we\nadd streaks? The more direct way to do\nit is through fire, right? Snapchat\nstarted everything with streaks. So we\ncan add like a fire element somewhere\nhere. I believe fire element somewhere\nhere.\nSomething like this. We specify fire\nstreaks. So we start we we count\npeople's streaks here and we can, you\nknow, figure something out here. Maybe\ngrowth rate, right? Growth rate, how\nmany days you saved. That is a very good\none.\nDays you\ngained, let's just say days you gain. So\nit just really keeps people in check,\nright? since I think streaks is a\ndefinitely a good incentive but you know\nreally making people recognize that wait\nI'm saving my life like that's the best\nthing you could ever do so streaks fire\nokay something like this definitely have\nto align all the paddings doesn't matter\nfor now that is the main page okay to-do\nlist page you can choose what they want\nand we have different categories okay so\nthe most important thing is to ensure a\nvery Clean design. Let's clean design\nto-do list page. You have to choose\ndifferent to-do list items. I'll just\ncreate like a bank of different items to\nchoose from. And definitely you have to\nremain like make sure the navigation is\nhere, right? So to-doistics page is\nprobably something like this. Drafted\nout. And since we're adding categories,\nI would say, you know, nutrition,\nexercise, we should probably have a\nplace where\nfirst we say this is the to-do list. Of\ncourse, we're not going to name it to-do\nlist. We're going to name it something a\nlot better, but you know, just so you\nknow, to-do list. And maybe on top we\ncan add some categorical\nvariations.\nSo maybe like this box is nutrition. And\nyou can if you click on it, you're going\nto see all the nutritional to-do list\nitems and nutrition, health, whatever,\nright? Different categories that we\nstill have to figure out things like\nthis. So this is to-do list page.\nPretty straightforward. Now we have AI.\nWhy do I include AI? Well, AI is very\neasy to implement. If you look you look\nat perplexity you look at open AAI they\nhave very cheap API tokens that you can\nsimply you can put chatbt into your app\nlike very it's a very simple process I\njust connect the API on the back end so\nwhy not put in that extra you know AI\npersonalized coached that help you\nenhance your health things like that so\nlet's just do a very simple chat\ninterface\nthis is the AI page AI coach let's just\nsay AI coach coach. So, this is the\ninput box\nand\nthis is the send button.\nSo, you're just going to have\nconversation like this and they're going\nto respond to you. You're probably going\nto say something more and they're just\ngoing to respond to you.\nYeah. And we call this maybe AI coach.\nJust make sure there's a clear\ndefinition. So you you ask questions\nhere and get answers.\nThat's pretty much it for AI coach. I\nwould say we can definitely implement\nyou know audio functionalities as well\nwhere we can maybe add another button\nhere but that's sort of extra and\ndefinitely not the main functionalities\nthat we need. It's a good add-on but we\ncan consider it later on but not for\nnow. So AI coach is also done. Now this\nis the real deal. life expectancy graph.\nPeople want to buy our app because of\nthe credibility and the accuracy, right?\nSo, you definitely have to make them\nfeel like again referring back to our\nvalue ad. Our value ad is we help people\nincrease their life. So, therefore, we\nhave to be accurate in our data and at\nleast the representation and packaging\nof our data. That has a lot to do with\nthe backend logic and the research we\ndo. But in terms of design, let's see\nhow we're going to present it. Again,\nyou know, you're not going to be\nbuilding a life clock, right? So, a\ntakeaway for you would be make sure what\nyour value ad is and make sure that each\npage is clearly addressing your value ad\nand don't add anything that would\npotentially disrupt that. Also, think of\nit like this.\nEach page has to be marketable, right?\nLike to-do list page, it's also\nmarketable, right? Like imag like\nimagine like a Tik Tok real saying this\napp aggregated everything to do for you\nto do to increase your life like it's a\ngood marketing tactic. If you see a\ngraph like a stock to a stock to\nrepresent your life that's good\nmarketing material. If you see an AI\ncoach talking to you about increase your\nlife expectancy that is a good marketing\nmaterial. A graph again more specific\ngraph would also make it better for you\nto market. Distribution is everything.\nIf you have a bad product, it does not\nreally matter if you have great\ndistribution. If you have a great\nproduct and great distribution, you are\nyou are set for life essentially. Okay.\nSo for the graph section, we have stock\ncharts that displays your life and\ndifferent subcategories being visualized\nsomehow.\nOkay. Well, that's very spe I would do\nlike different stock graphs for\ndifferent parts of life. So probably\nsomething like this like each is a very\nit's a you know it's a very small graph\nand a small graph about you know maybe\nareas you can areas that you could\nimprove or things like that. Let me\nthink. Also, it's definitely not going\nto be like this. There's definitely\ngoing to be some radius like this when\nwe're actually designing it. But I'm\nthinking maybe items that we can track,\nright? So\nyou can't change your age, race, weight.\nYou can change the way you diet. So that\ncould be one change. Exercise, one\nthing. Water and sleep quality. That are\nthose are four things. That's great.\nLet's just stick with four for now. We\ncan we can definitely, you know, alter a\nlot of the designs later on if we don't\nlike them.\nSo just imagine this.\nSo these are four different graphs each\nrepresenting different things that you\ncould do to improve your life. This\nwould be a overall general graph of your\nlife. Great. So this is going to be like\nthis is probably going to be like oh you\nhave oh I'm thinking maybe you can say\nyeah you have x days left\nright and if they're using it you can\nyou can be like oh wait but you added 10\ndays this week somehow like a very small\nsmall reminder you added 10 weeks\n10 days this week or this month depends\non our backend logic and then this could\njust be you\nexercise\nand through exercise maybe you gained\ngained 69 60 days in total. So you could\nsee like what areas of life are you\ngaining from sleep while you're losing a\nlot on sleep. So maybe you can say\ndays from sleep. So you can identify\nwhat matters the most in terms of\nincreasing your life expectancy. This is\nextremely good for categories, right?\nAnd definitely for this, we have to make\nit a bit upwards so that there's place\nfor the navigation bar, but that's\nbeyond the point. So, it's going to look\nsomething like this, right? So, yeah, we\npretty much have a entire wireframe for\nour app. Now,\nthere are spec specific popups that we\nhave to do. For example, if you maybe\nclick on this, is there going to say\nanything? Is it going to say anything?\nIs it going to say anything on streaks?\nAre we going to have, you know, like a\nranking system within region? Well,\nsince is a it is a single userbased app,\nwe are thinking probably not\nincorporating regional rankings in the\nsystem. But instead, let's just make the\nvalue ad very direct directed towards\nthis the user and you know our app's\nvalue ad is not dependent on the user\ncount. Right? It would be nice if we\nhave more ratings on the app store. But\nit does not matter since our value at\n100% does not matter whether we have\nfive users or 100 users or 5,000 users.\nThe value that the user get from the app\nis equal regardless. This is the best\napp possible because your app is already\noptimized in terms of their the value\nproposition from the get-go.\nGreat. Now, this is pretty much\neverything and I'll see you in the next\none to design the widget. Hello\neveryone. Welcome back. And in this\nsection, we're going to go over how to\nset up the backend logic for your app.\nSo as you might know we are building a\nan app called life clock where we might\nchange the name later but we predict\npeople's life expecties right so how do\nwe actually do that as you might recall\nwe have an onboarding flow of 22 20ome\nquestions right so we have 20 20ome\nquestions and the of course the reason\nwhy we do this is to so that we could\ncustomize experience but also at the\nsame time lure them into you know since\nthey're they're giving up their time to\ndo is questionnaire. They want to see an\noutcome and if they see their outcome\nbut like before then you set a pay wall\nthey're more likely to pay for it,\nright? So the those are the two reasons\nwhy we did the multiple onboarding\nquestions at first. Now how do we\nactually set up backend logic? Well, we\nwe first do background research, right?\nWhat impacts a person's life expectancy?\nWell, in our case, right, sleep for\nsure. We have 22 different variables\nthat are playing with each other. For\nexample, if you're 15 years old and you\nsleep two hours per day, then the impact\non your life expectancy could be and\nshould be a lot lesser than someone\nlet's say 50 years old and they only\nsleep one hour per day, right? The\nimpact depending on your projected\nhealth is like that as the variable\nwould like change dramatically in terms\nof the impact. So we have to set up the\nlogic for that. And there's a lot of\nthings that come into play. For example,\nif you sleep two hours per day, but you\nalso exercise that might actually be\nnegative. So when we're giving out, you\nknow, medical advice or, you know,\nthings involving your health, we have to\nbe extremely careful. Well, it is a very\ntedious process that involves us\nresearching hundreds if not thousands of\nresearch reports and aggregating them to\nfind the best equation to just to see\nhow the variable plays with each other.\nBut let's take height GPT for example to\nsimplify it. It's our second app, right?\nWe predict people's height and we show\nthem ways how to maximize it. So we\npredict and maximize height. So, well,\nit's actually fairly straightforward.\nThere's an equation that you can use to\npredict height, which is I I believe\nyour your dad's height plus your mom's\nheight, and then\nyou divide them by two,\ndivide them by two, and then if you're a\nguy, you add 13. And if you're a girl,\nyou minus 13. That would be your height\nin centimeters. So, something like that,\nright? Of course, we aggregated a lot\nmore medical research reports to enhance\nthis equation, but this is our equation\nof calculating the backend logic. So,\njust preparing everything that you're\ngoing to need for this. And on our app,\nwe also had another section that said\nyou are taller than x% of people your\nage. So, what what would that require?\nWell, that would require us to actually\nfind the base in which we're going to\nbase the number off of, right? So first\nwe have to find a report of the average\nheight\nof people your age. And then what do we\nhave to do? We have to basically\ndetermine what our height is in terms of\nlike the positioning of of like as that\nwith that base number in mind. You have\nto evaluate you know are you top 10% 20%\nright? So you're going to have to find a\nreport that averages that details\naverage height of people your age and\nthen use that as a base base number\nand so it's so to calculate the actual\npercentage. So this is a very simple\nlogic but you understand you need it to\nfind a report first like a proven a very\ncredible report so that it justifies\nyour calculation. You can't just give a\nrandom, oh wait, I think if that guy's\n56 foot, then maybe I will just put him\nin the top 5 percentile. You can't do\nthings like that since you're selling it\nto other people. Well, the same logic\nwould apply to any app that requires any\ncalculation. You find the basic\ninformation of the basic reports,\nmedical reports or you know any academia\npapers that supports what you're trying\nto calculate and then you use that, you\ncreate a logic that actually makes sense\nand you write out the logic flow. then\nit it's going to be a lot easier when\nyou're actually coding it. But yeah,\nthat is the section for back-end logic.\nIt's fairly simple. In short, find and\ndo your re find research reports. Do\nyour fair share of research. Use that as\na base to justify the equation that\nyou're using to calculate anything. And\nthat'll be it. Thank you. Hello\neveryone. Welcome back to the design\nsection. Now, we finished our wireframe\nand we have a good design here. Since we\nwe you know, we're building live clock,\nright? That's definitely not something\nyou're building. So, instead of taking\nyou through the like the 10 hours that\nwe spend building the user interface,\nspecific designs, each button, it's\nreally repetitive. I just finished it my\non my end and I'll teach you the entire\nreasoning and also things that you have\nto basically understand so that you\ncould also build your own design. Now I\njust categorize everything here so\nthere's a better division but this is a\ngood design that I saw on app store. So\nthis is a gym app and uh it's a dark\ntheme widget. It looks like a widget\nbased app right like different sections\non on the app. I think it looks\nextremely aesthetic and follows like the\niOS typical UI design principles where\nthe corner is around you know 20\nsomething and uh it's very it's just\naligned and also looks really nice and\nwith apps that has a very clear value\nproposition if you make it extremely\neasy to understand people like for for\npeople to understand what your app\nactually does just by looking at it like\nI can I can just look at look at this\nand I understand it's a gym app I don't\neven need uh explanation here or\nworkouts, right? Like it says it for\nitself and is a very easy to understand\noutline. Now, I like this theme. So, I'm\npretty sure there are apps that you\npersonally really like as well. So, I'll\njust take a screenshot, import it to\nFigma and just base off our design on\nthat. Now,\nwe started building our app, right? The\nauthentication part, you understand? We\njust, you know, we set it like a tone\nand like, you know, it took me um the\nmajority of the time is spent on the\nmain pages, but once you have the style\ndown and you're more used to the style,\nfor example, like the buttons here, we\nonly have corner radius equals 15 or 16,\nright? Like we always have that. So,\nit's literally copy and paste. You\nfinish this. Okay, I'll just control\nCtrl +VR Ctrl + V. Right? Like it's very\nsimple once you have the workflow and\nthe style in place. So the production\ntime is definitely not linear. It's\nexponential to a point and then it it\ndefinitely like flattens out, but it's\nfine.\nAs you might know, first first part this\nlogo also we it's just a placeholder.\nThis is version one by the way. So\ndefinitely not perfect. when users sign\nin with Google, you know, enter your\nname and your age, things like that.\nI'll teach you a few things that you\nactually need to understand. So,\nassuming like you can skip this part if\nyou're rather ex experienced with Figma,\nbut I'll go through the basic\nfunctionalities of Figma for the next 10\n10 minutes, I would say. So, how do you\nactually create text like this? Let's\njust start with this simple design. You\ngo to text section and you start typing.\nIf you want to change the font,\nhighlight it. Go to typography on the\nright hand side design under typography.\nThere are multiple fonts that you can\nchoose from.\nYou can change the thickness of it as\nwell. Also, the size,\nright? This is very interesting. You can\nactually change the spacing between the\nletters as well. So, it's called letter\nspacing. So, neg five. It's it sticks\ntogether. Actually looks pretty nice. Um\nif I were to stick this together letter\nspacing right look it's different feel\nthings like that also if you want to\nagain as I just said uh change the\ncorner radius you just go down to the\nright hand side everything is in design\nby the way you go down appearance corner\nradius you can adjust it to 60 right\nsomething like that and also opacity can\nchange 50 so it's like slightly\ntransparent it's nice when you're doing\nlike a popup where like a slight popup\nnotification where just like a pop-up\ntransparent screen. That would also look\nreally nice. To change color, you go to\nfill and here's where it gets pretty\ninteresting. So, you can just drag and\nit changes color, right? But also, if\nyou click on this part, it actually\nchanges the gradient. You can have\ngradient settings. This looks really\nbad, but you just click on the two\ndifferent colors that you would want and\nthen you can adjust the extent in which\nit is glowing.\nThen you just change both to whatever\nyou want. And this I could probably see\nit with purple a bit more. This actually\nlooks better, a lot better I would say,\nright? If you were to do this, but\ndefinitely that's not something we want\nto go for for a death clock because\nagain theme consistency is extremely\nimportant.\nBut anyways, that's I had some problem\nwith the uh camera, but now it's good.\nJust wanted to show you everything.\nRight. Then for this, enter your name.\nIt's very simple to create a box. Just\ngo to this thing that looks like a box\nand you draw a box out. That's all. And\nthen you can also adjust the corner\nradius here.\nSo for example, this is this thing is\ncalled it's uh it's yeah it's 13.43.\nProbably not ideal. You can do 50. If I\ndo 50 do 50 specifically\nalso one thing is if there are also a\nthing called frames. So\nyeah. So this is a shape that you can\nchange by directly editing it. But also\nif you press F and you draw a frame,\nthis is a frame in which you could put\nthese shapes into\nand it's it's not going to go out of the\nframe if you if you if you just stay\nwithin the the reasonable environment of\nthe frame. But also when you want to\nexport everything that is in a frame,\nyou go down to export and you click on\nthe frame itself and you export the\nframe.\nThis is especially good it because if\nyou just have a square instead of like a\nframe and you do any sort of design on\nit, right? To do any sort of design. So\nyou put in any sort of design, it's not\ngoing to export this design itself. It's\ngoing to export the box only since you\nonly chose the box. It's fine if you are\nin the middle of designing it and you\ndon't know how to export it since you\ncan just press F\ncircle everything here and it's going to\nframe it for you so that you could\nexport everything together at once. Now\nlet's go to the recency like the recency\nof importance for layers. So everything\nthat is further to the top would appear\nfirst in front of all the other shapes.\nSo, for example, if the rectangle is in\nfront of the the red rectangle is in\nfront of the gray one. So, if I want to\nmake it disappear, I can make it rank\nlower in recency. So, it's going to be\nbehind this rectangle.\nSee? So, it really just shifts. And this\nis a frame. So, you can organize like a\nfolder based off of different frames.\nEach frame is a small folder. Now, I can\njust circle everything, delete\neverything. So, this is a frame. And you\ncan name the frame. So it's better for\nyou to market as well. Now this is the\nonboarding. So we have the hover effect,\nright? When user choose a button, it has\nto look different from other buttons. So\nthey click it and it shows a different\ncolor. You click next, different color,\nyou click next, next, things like that.\nWe haven't deter determined, you know,\nthe actual color at this point, but\nyou're going to see it later on. Now\nafter onboarding, as you guys might\nknow, we need the incentive structure in\nplace. So we are thinking to put a a\nwall where basically after filling out\n20 questions imagine 20 questions being\nfilled out and then there's a screen\nsaying generating results and after\ngenerating the results you see this\ndeath date extended lifespan stuff like\nthat. Maybe we disclose the death date\nso that they actually get something out\nof it like something like this, right?\nBut in order to unlock this, you have to\npay. Well, you're curious now, right?\nLike after aggregating all that data\nfrom your end that you're spent all the\ntime, you see this and then you click\nnext steps.\nThere's no menu here. You click next\nsteps.\nYou see this? Oh, wait. Also, I can you\nsee you see the value out of the app.\nOh, wait. can. Oh, there all these\nthings I can do. That's great. And I\nwant to review my longevity plan. Maybe\nthat's going to get me the answers.\nWell, boom. You're hit with the payw\nwall.\nOf course, we have to change everything\nhere. It's just a placeholder. Also,\nthis is like something we can put in the\nfuture as well. I'm just putting it here\nas a placeholder. If you, you know, fake\nrankings in your app, right? That Google\nPlay Store is not going to allow that\nsince it is fake advertisement.\nAnd you just choose your plan and then\nyou subscribe and you pay for it. after\nsubscribing that is the entire\nonboarding flow. The onboarding flow is\nfinished after they pay. So everything\nbefore the payw wall and after they you\nknow they've been paying that is\nonboarding flow. Now once you're on the\npay wall if they click on this maybe we\nshould say something like oh I know you\ndon't like the deal. How about this?\nI'll take a 25% 50% off for you but you\ncan buy it. Right? Those those are are\nlike you know structures that you can\nput in place for better marketing. But\nonboarding flow flow onboarding flow is\ndone. And now on to the main page. This\nis what you see on the main page. I\nthink we followed a very similar\napproach to what they're doing. And this\nis so far what I have. Probably we're\ngoing to remove the drop shadow\nfunction.\nIt's probably going to look a lot\nbetter. Drop shadow is basically this\nthis thing right here, the glowy effect\nthat makes it look pretty fancy, but\nit's definitely not necessary. And yeah,\nonce you remove it, it's probably got\nit's divided based off of sections. You\ncan scroll down, but yeah, this is the\nvalue ad. You know, your death date,\nright? You know, your extended lifespan,\nyour possibility so that people don't\nturn away. If they know that if they\nkeep using your app, they're going to\nincrease, you know, like sort of like\nsaving money, right? People like saving\nmoney since it makes them feel proud and\naccomplished. Imagine using that same\npsychology, but just to extend your\nlifespan as a great way. Also these are\nstreaks. So gamified elements where um\nyou can track days in which you\ncompleted the items and days in which\nyou didn't. So you can understand the\nvisualization of your self-discipline.\nBasically time left to die. This is\nreally nice since it creates a sense of\nurgency for people to first not only\nthey want to see this every day so they\nunderstand how many days they have left\nbut also creates urgency for them to\nactually keep using the app since the\napp is positioned as the to the users to\nextend their life and most likely ways\nto die again incentive structure so this\nis really nice but we have the AI\nchatbot pretty pretty much modeled it\nafter tragic\nmargins here as I said it's version one\nSo it's standard chatbot that connects\nto an API from open AI uh we don't have\nto build the AI ourself and then we have\nthe to-do list item in which it's nice\nto categorize based off of date and so\nthat you can have like also better\nvisualization completed the task and\npending tasks and as I just told you\nguys as you can build this simply by\nwhat I just told you right you create a\nbox decrease corner margin corner radius\nuse text type in text and now you have a\nbutton. You just do do it multiple\ntimes. It's also nice if you have the\nwireframe next to you so that you can\nunderstand sort of like what should be\non each page since that's the entire use\nof having a wire frame. And here we have\nthe categories of different to-do list\nitems and check it off things like that\nwhich will be reflected on here from\npending tasks to completed tasks and on\nmain pages is going to be reflected\nright and we're still thinking what we\nwant to do for longevity plan. But as\nyou can see this is the actual process\nof building an app. We build it section\nby section and once we have a good\nunderstanding good structured design for\neach page then we go through version two\nof refinement where we ask people um how\nthey feel about the user. Basically,\ngather user feedback, right? Like just\npurely on the design perspective so that\nwe can just build the right design from\nthe get-go when we're coding it. Then we\nrefine it again and again. And yeah,\nthat's uh pretty much it for the flow,\ncurrent design that we have. Uh you\ncould just use the skill that I just\ntaught you to apply to your own app as\nwell. But make sure to keep everything\norganized so that you know I understand\nthe entire flow. Page one, page two,\npage three, page four, page five, page\nsix, and 20 something, you know, and\nlike 19 other pages. After that, you\nyou're hit with this hit with this pay\nwall and it leads you to the main page\nin the second section of the design.\nThank you for watching and I'll see you\nin the next one. In order to get\nauthentication to properly work and just\nFirebase in general, we want to make\nsure to install the proper packages. And\nthis is exactly how we do that running\nthese commands. And yeah, these will\ntake care of proper installation of the\nGoogle authentication package um Google\nsignin, Apple signin and firebased\nauthentication particularly for also if\nyou want to do like email off and things\nlike that. So we'll install the these\npackages and then we'll dive right into\nsetting up both Google and Apple\nauthentication.\nOkay,\nthese the packages are properly\ninstalled and just if you want to double\ncheck just make sure they show up in the\npackage.json.\nAnd now something really important that\nwe need to do before uh actually getting\num\nApple authentication to work uh you want\nto make sure you you are able to run a\niOS development build. And the way you\ndo that is by running uh npx npx expo\nrun iOS. And we I already ran this uh\nbefore as you can see but I'll run it\nagain. And what that does is if you're\nif everything is properly configured\nwith a X your Xcode and things like\nthat. This will first of all create a\ndevelopment build. Uh but it will then\nalso um\nyou just want to make sure that you're\nactually able to run a development build\nbecause app authentication will not work\nif it is not a development build. So\nwith Expo Go, Apple O and Google O will\nnot work. So make sure you run that.\nMake sure um it actually works.\nNow in order to get app authentication\nto properly work, you need to register\nyour app bundle with um the app store so\nthat you can actually enable uh sign in\ncap Apple sign in capabilities. And the\nreason we do this is obviously because\nwhen people download the app from the\napp store, we want Apple authentication\nto work. But uh and it's also because it\nactually won't work unless you do it\neither way in a in a simulator. So what\nyou have to do is uh pretend you're\nadding a new app, right? And then go to\ncertificates, identifiers, and profiles.\nAnd what you need to do here is I'm not\nsure if you guys remember I explained it\nearlier, but for your app, you basically\nhave a bundle ID that in my case was\nsomething like com.gm455\nuh death counter app\nsome it was something along those lines.\nI can check back in my code and make\nsure you add a description over here.\nAnd obviously this the bump ID has to be\ncorrect like it will not work unless\nit's correct. And then here you will\nenable app capabilities which means that\nyou're allowing your app to basically\nlike you're making sure that your app\ncan actually support uh Apple\nauthentication. And uh what you would do\nright here is go to\njust you can just command F uh Apple\nsign in sign in with Apple right here.\nAnd then let's actually set up uh\npurchases as well. So inapp purchases is\nalready selected right there.\nAnd yeah, and then after this then you\ncan click continue uh and then actually\nregister uh the one I already registered\nmine but then here in your so I'm not\ngoing to register it again but in here\nthis is exactly what you would do. Click\nregister so that you're actually uh good\nto go. Once that once that's actually\nregistered then your app is actually\nable to uh support uh Apple\nauthentication.\nAnd this used to be something that you\nhad to do, but you definitely don't have\nto do this anymore, which is basically\nconfiguring the certificate manually,\nbut definitely do not have to do that\nanymore. And for Firebase, let's just\nmake sure that uh we've got app\nauthentication enabled, which we do\nright here. And there's actually no uh\nother configuration that we need to do\non our end for Apple authentication to\nactually work. And uh all this stuff if\nyou want to do is uh optional and not\nactually necessary. We we can get it to\nwork without it. So, let's finish up app\nauthentication and actually get it to\nwork uh within our code and then we'll\nmove on to Google authentication which\nis actually a little bit more tricky.\nAnd I just want to add again for things\nlike this you should definitely should\ndefinitely use AI. This is what I did my\nfirst time. I literally just asked AI\nlike how do I set up app authentication\nfor my mobile app? And it walks you\nthrough it. Sometimes it doesn't work\nexactly but it definitely sets you on\nthe right track. And right now we'll go\nthrough the code like step by step and\nI'll show you exactly how to set it up.\nUh but I'm just letting you know that's\nsomething that you should def you should\ndefinitely uh you should definitely\nalways do.\nA package that I forgot to mention that\nis necessary to install is React Native\nFirebase app. Uh which is very crucial\nto for it to actually work. So uh just\nmake sure to run this command right here\nbefore and then you should be good. We\nshould be good to go. So,\nwe're only going to focus on Apple\nauthentication for now and we'll get\ninto Google authentication later. So, so\nsomething but also something I want to\nexplain before we actually uh look into\napp authentication is we want to make\nsure is how exactly we're setting up the\nthis this main page. So depending on\nwhether they are on iOS or Android, we\nwant to display different things, right?\nSo this is exactly what we're doing. So,\nif users are on iOS, then we want to\nshow the options of Google and\nand Apple. If they are not, then we're\nonly going to display Google or email.\nNow, you'll see this is obviously giving\nme an error right now because I haven't\nset up authentication with email just\nyet, but that's how it's going to work.\nSo, you guys remember I explained in a\nprevious video what touchable opacity\ndoes. It's basically uh any interactive\nthing. Usually 99% of the time we're\ntalking about buttons. So obviously this\nwas already set up in the code that\nClaude gave us in the beginning. But now\nwe actually have to connect it to an\nactual working back end, right? So the\nway we do this is uh for Apple, we want\nto connect it to we basically add a\nmethod that had that gets called\nwhenever users actually want to sign in\nwith Apple. So this method is called\nhandle Apple signin and we're just\nsaying with the on price property we're\nsaying that when this is clicked then\ncall that method and yeah so how how\ndoes this actually work? So once the\nmethod is called we're just making sure\nthat we're on iOS just it's good to add\nthese double checks because uh if you\ndon't do that you might run into you\nknow into errors and you're not sure\nwhere they're coming from. Uh this is\njust in case the first check for the\nplatform or what the type of device\nfails. Now this is all code that's not\nuh you know obviously no one is like\nexpected to memorize and keep in mind\nthe reason I have so many uh console\nlogs in my code is just to detect errors\nreally easily and figure out where they\nare. Definitely something not necessary\nthat you need to have. So the first\nthing we need to do is actually import\nApple O from the package that we\ninstalled and Apple O is what allows us\nto actually like make the request to\nApple uh if that makes sense. And when\nwe want to actually use it, we basically\nhave to make a request to hit the Apple\nservers to get back or we need to\nactually um\nyou know sign in with Apple. This is all\ncode that's all present in their in the\ndocumentation for React Native and for\nFirebase as well. So React Native and\nFirebase obviously and specifically the\npackages that that we just installed. Uh\nI don't know this by heart. I don't\nthink anyone should know it by heart.\nAnd uh it's simply a type of code that\nyou basically you use once and then you\njust make sure to copy and paste it in\nother code projects so that uh you\nbasically know how to use it. And the\nimportant thing to know is that um\nbasically where the Firebase code this\nuh differentiates differentiates itself\nfrom uh the code that is specifically\nrelated to the Apple signin package. And\nthe most important thing that is uh\nwhenever we're talking about uh Apple O\nprovider or uh performing requests to\nApple like whenever we're sending\nrequests we're usually talking about um\nthat's usually dealing exclusively with\nthe invertase Apple uh Apple signin\npackage and that's why we're doing this\nright here. And again we're simply what\nthis is simply doing is just make a\nrequest to Apple to make sure that we\ncan set up Google sign in. And then\nwe're actually um then we get when the\nuser actually\nand then we're setting these variables\nonce the user signs in. And what we're\ndoing is now we're actually connecting\nto Firebase and passing in the\ncredentials that we get through Apple's\nuh server which actually creates the\npopup that says you know sign in with\nApple and allows you to check hide my\nemail or don't hide my email. and we're\npassing in these credentials that we get\nfrom that into um basically to Firebase\nand using the sign in with credential\nmethod that Firebase uh gives us. And\nthen again, we have a pretty good error\nlog just to make sure uh we're on the\nsame page. And then the really good\nthing about Apple is that when you sign\nin with Apple, you're able to it it is\nalso gets your name if that makes sense.\nIt's the same thing that happens when\nyou sign in with Google. So technically,\nwe wouldn't need to collect the user's\nname. And what we're doing here is just\nmaking sure that if uh we're able to\ncollect the user's name, which I mean\nworst case scenario, the name is empty\nor something. Someone set up an app ID\nwith an empty name, which I don't even\nthink is possible. Um\neither way, we're making sure to store\nthat uh locally to the user's data. And\nyou see here how we're using uh we're\nalso storing all these details like the\nemail and the uh the name, the again the\nemail and the a specific unique code for\nthe user. We're storing all of that\nlocally with async storage which is what\nyou've used until now to store data\nlocally and then once everything is uh\nhappened successfully then we we're\ntaking them to the uh full name page.\nNow the reason we're doing this is\nbecause uh just to be sure like we want\nto make sure that we have accurate\ninformation from the user like for\nexample a lot of people set up their\naccounts with like random names and for\nI don't know if your name is like gamer\n65 you might not want to set up this\nwith the name gamer 65 but it is true\nthat sometimes Apple causes problems\nwhen you ask for the name after Apple\nsignin pillar our first app actually got\nrejected for one for for that being one\nof the reasons so we have to basically\nremove the uh direction basically on\nuser sign in with they we just didn't uh\nask for their name again because I guess\nApple didn't like that. But also other\ntimes it got accepted when we had that.\nSo it it goes case by case. Then um\nagain these are uh just error logs just\nto make sure that if something goes\nwrong we know exactly where to find it.\nUh if you guys you guys obviously feel\nfree to copy this code um as well and\nlike for how authentication is set up.\nIt is again all of this is really all\nthat matters making a request to Apple\nand then uh saving the data locally and\nalso uh actually storing the user in\nFirebase authentication so that they can\nlog in later and their account is\nactually saved and then we save all the\ndata locally like I just said and then\nredirect them so they can actually enjoy\nthe experience of uh using the app and\nagain this is just a logs.\nSo, we can actually test this right now.\nAnd we just want to make sure that we're\nin a um in a development uh development\nbuild running a development build. And\nthis is exactly how we check it. So,\nwhenever actually we need to make sure\nto be uh in the right folder, but once\nwe do that then we can run npx expo\nstart. And if it says development build,\nthen we should be good. If we want to\nswitch back to explo, which we don't\nwant to do when testing authentication,\nthen we can click S. But either way,\nwe're in development build. I want to\nopen my device with development build\njust to make sure that everything is set\nup to work properly.\nNow the development build is properly\nrunning. Let's look at uh our device.\nDevelopment build is properly working.\nLet's test sign in with Apple. So this\nshould work exactly. So I can set up my\naccount. Select whether I want to share\nmy name. then you know put in my\npassword and then uh actually use this.\nSo what you might have to make sure is\nthat you are set up with a test account\nfor um\nuh disregard this error. This is purely\nbecause I canceled the sign in. So\nyou'll get this error, but users won't\nactually get it if they say cancel the\nsignin. Any error that you get here,\nespecially if it's a popup that looks\nlike this, unless you hard code you put\nit in your code that the you want the\nerror to be displayed, users will not\nactually see this if something goes\nwrong. So keep that in mind. But here uh\nbasically what I'm saying is you want to\nmake be make sure you want to make sure\nthat you're set up with a tester account\nuh tester Apple account for my iPhone\n16. I basically created for this like\nthis virtual iPhone 16. I created a\nparticular Apple account that I set up\nin my Apple developer settings that I\ncan use that is set up as a tester so\nthat has full access to everything and\nthat will actually work for um any any\napp u that I test in development or uh\nwith test flight. So, I'll show you real\nquick how to do that. And it's pretty\nstraightforward, but Apple Yeah, Apple\ndoes not like you testing this stuff\nwith real Apple IDs, especially when it\ncomes to subscriptions because you don't\nwant to get charged um for a product\nthat doesn't exist. So, it's just like a\nsafety thing that Apple does. But you\nbut either way, you can before we get to\nsetting up tester account, you can see\nhow apputhentication properly works. So\nonce I enter my password, then uh I will\nactually be able to be directed to the\num\nfull name page. And if you're not\ngetting this pop-up, there's definitely\nsome configuration error. Just make sure\nyour code for the authentication looks\nfor Apple signin looks exactly the way\nit does here. And then I highly suggest\nusing Claude. Uh what I always do is\nwhenever I have a bug, I ask Claude,\nplease add a set of u error logs at\nevery step so that I know exactly where\nit's failing. So like basically I log\nsomething at every step of the process\nso that when something doesn't get\nlogged I'm like okay this is exactly\nwhere the problem is happening.\nOkay so this is exactly how to do it\nwhen you if you want to test a an\naccount which is actually going to be\nreally crucial when testing testing\npayments. So here you want to go open\nyour uh your app store connect and go to\nusers and access. Here you'll be able to\nset up a sandbox account. So you can\nclick plus enter you know fake name uh\nand then fake usergmail.com\npassword whatever whatever it is right\num and just make sure uh I always make\nsure that the emails are actually real\nbecause sometimes Apple so basically the\nsimulators can't actually detect whether\nit's in a test account unless you're\nactually trying to use it to do an\naction in an app on a simulator. So\nsometimes the simulators will ask you to\nverify your account if the email isn't\nreal. you can't actually verify it. So,\nthis is an really old email that I had,\nso that's why I used it as well. So,\nkeep keep that in mind as well. So,\nyeah, highly recommend doing this and\nhighly recommend setting up your\nemulator with a sandbox account. It will\nmake a lot of things easier and will\nhelp you get over a lot of bugs that are\nactually due to trying to make\noperations with a real Apple account. In\norder to make sure that uh login\nfunctionalities properly work, you want\nto obviously check that in the database\nfirebased database authentication\ndatabase uh the users are actually\nsaved. So uh if I try to sign with Apple\nfor example, then I select my account, I\npaste in the password for my test\naccount and then I just want to make\nsure this is actually properly displayed\nhere. So I refresh the page and that\nmeans the user is properly stored. And\nthis is really important because when a\nuser tries to log in next time,\nobviously we need to know that they\nalready have an account so that they\ndon't have to start the whole thing from\nscratch. So yeah, really important to do\nand you can delete it if you want to\ntest again and things like that.\nNow let's talk about Google\nauthentication. Google authentication is\ndefinitely a bit more challenging purely\nbecause uh of the configuration files\nthat it requires. It's not like um Apple\nwhere all you have to do is basically\nput in the code, set up a certificate in\num Apple developer in when it comes to\nGoogle authentication. First of all,\nthere are usually more issues with uh\npackage dependencies not uh matching in\nterms of versions and things like that\nand some of those are actually out of\nyour control which is quite frustrating\nas a developer. But the most important\nthing is that you understand how to set\nup the basics. Uh the main thing that\nyou need to understand is that for\nauthentication for both um Android and\niOS you need to download a file in your\nsettings which for iOS is going to be uh\nthe Google service info.p list and for\num Android it's going to be called\nGoogle services.json. So let's download\nthis right now. And the reason why you\nneed Xcode is because you want to make\nsure that this file is properly added to\nyour project. You don't just want it to\nbe a file that's um drag and dropped in\nthere. You want to make sure it's added\nto your target, which I'll explain\nexactly what that means once we actually\nopen up Xcode. Uh make sure uh you're\nobviously familiar with all these\ndetails. And for the Android version,\nlike I said, it's the Google\nservices.json. What's really nice about\nAndroid that at least the setup is not\nas hard as it is for um\nit's not as challenging as it is for iOS\nor at least not as tricky if that makes\nsense. So let's go to I want to show you\nguys something. So whenever you sign in\nwith Google, you set up authentication\nwith Google, this is what it's going to\nlook like. So you're going to have a\npopup that basically asks you um are you\nsure you want to sign in to this\nspecific app? So if you don't actually\nconfigure your app properly, uh this\nwill first of all show a very weird\ncode. Like it's going to show something\nalong the lines of project uh and then a\nreally long number which is something\nthat you might not like think is\nimportant, but as a user when I see that\nit's like it's already like it creates\nmore friction. It's kind of weird. So\nyou want to make sure that this actually\nshows up shows your app's name. And we\nalso want to make sure that we just\nproperly configure Google so everything\ngoes smoothly and we don't run into\nerrors. And an easy way to make uh make\nsure of that is to go to your Google\nCloud Console.\nAn easy way to make sure that your\nproject is set up properly and that it\nactually looks official is to go to your\nGoogle Cloud Console, then click API and\nservices and go to the OOTH consent\nscreen page. And this page will\nbasically uh allow you to set up\nyour authentication so that it actually\nlooks it actually shows your app's name.\nI already set this up, but the most\nimportant thing is to change this\nbecause this is probably going to say\nproject and a really long number. Make\nsure this is the name of your app. Then\nyou can set your app logo over here,\nprivacy policy, things like that. And\nthen you definitely do need a support\nemail as a developer. So this is\nsomething that might seem really small\nbut actually cause problems in the\nfuture and test people that are\nreviewing your app actually don't like\nit. So a lot of times they might\nactually even reject it for such a small\nreason like this. So it's something that\nyou really do need to keep in mind.\nOkay, now let's look at the setup for uh\niOS for Google signin. And again, the\nstructure is the same as in terms of\nlike how we package it. It's the same\nstructure as Apple signin. Uh but\nthere's a few things we need to keep in\nmind, especially when it comes to this\nschool service info.p file. So this\nbasically contains configuration\ninformation that is crucial to get that\nlike Google popup and actually\nfor us to know when the authentication\nwith Google was actually successful. So\nthat's why we need need that file. Now\nyou actually need to place it right\nthere. Uh I just placed it like that for\nso that I could show you guys. Uh but\nthat's not actually the right place to\nput it. So first of all I want to go\nthrough the code so that you guys can\nunderstand um\nexactly how to set up cool sign within\nthe code itself before we actually make\nsure that the file with the\nconfiguration information is properly\nset. So the way we do it again same\nstructure as the apple sign. We have a\ntouchable opacity which means any\ninteractive thing which is usually a\nbutton and then we attach a method to it\ncalled Google handle Google signin when\nusers actually try to um\nusually uh users actually try to click\nthe button that we want that popup to\nshow up.\nSo all right so we're just again this is\nthe same we're implementing the same\nchecks to make sure that we are either\non Android or iOS and the actual process\ndoesn't change much. It's more so um\njust that we if there is anything that's\nspecific to the platform, we want to\nmake sure we're aware of that in the\ncode. Then\nagain, these are just checks. This is\nactually not necessary. Again, I like I\nsaid, I like to use claw to add a lot of\num debugging logs to my code so that I\nknow where the error is when I find one.\nUh so just letting you know that. But\nwhen it comes to actually setting up a\nsign in, there's really one line that\nonly one line that's necessary. And\nthat's Google sign insignin. And this is\nwhat's going to cause the pop-up to\nactually show. And your code actually\nwill automatically detect whether the\nGoogle service file is actually pres\npresent. So you don't even need to\ndeclare its location inside the code.\nThen if the login is successful, then\nthe signin result will basically contain\na bunch of data about the successful\nlogin. And\nhere we just have to make sure we get\nthe uh the correct data. Then we pass it\nto Firebase so that the authentication\nis properly saved. So for example, if I\nwere to sign in with my email, uh this\nwouldn't this would sign me in but it\nwouldn't actually save my data or like\ncreate my account in Firebase\nauthentication so I can actually see it\nif that makes sense. And and this allows\nthe actual signin to happen, right? and\nwith the correct credentials based on\nwhat I filled out basically what Google\naccount I selected and then once that is\ncompleted then we do the same thing that\nwe did for Apple where we save all the\ndata locally with to async storage and\nthen after that we take them to the next\npage so you see how the structure is\nbasically the same these are just a few\nlines that again I don't recommend you\nmemorize you can either use AI to\ngenerate this but uh these are a few\nlines that are necessary to um to\nactually do authentication right so sign\nin with credential and then you want to\nmake sure that um you're actually\ncalling you know the Google signin\nmethod and this is imported from the uh\nthe library right the library that we\nimported so react native Google signin\nso once uh and that is really all the\nsetup you need for uh Google signin to\nactually work and what something that we\nactually need to do before uh setting\nour code actually runs is something that\nwe actually don't have to do with Apple\nit is something that we don't actually\nhave to do with Apple because we're in\nan iOS device and Apple just makes it\nrelative relatively easy, but we\nactually need to configure our Google\nsettings to connect to our Firebase,\nwhich is also connected to our Google\nCloud console account. And basically,\nwhenever you create a project, web\nproject or is project on Firebase, it\ncreates uh these credentials, right? So\nfor a web project, it has a specific\ncode for that web project, specific code\nfor that app project depending on\nwhether it's OOS on Android. So all we\nneed to make sure to do is basically\nconfigure Google signin before we\nactually use uh Google signin right here\nlater on in the code. So this is just\nsomething that you have to do. Uh it's\npart of the process. It's a little\nfrustrating because it's a bit more\ncomplicated than Apple, but still uh you\nhave to make sure that this is properly\nconfigured and the where you get these\ncodes is Google Cloud Console. So I can\nshow you right now exactly uh where to\nfind them.\nAnd you find these in let's go back to\nour um to Google Google Cloud Console\nAPI and services. And where you find\nthem is your credentials right here. And\nthe codes are the OA client ID. So if\nyou were to click on this, it would\nactually show you the code. Obviously,\nI'm not going to show you my codes, but\nuh you get these are this code right\nhere is what you would copy and paste\ninto your into the configuration\nsettings. So make this is what the\nactual flow looks like to set up Google\nauthentication.\nI import everything from the library. I\nconfigure Google SignIn with the codes\nthat I get from Google Cloud Console. I\ncall Google Signin methods to actually\nget the pop-up to show. And then the\nfinal step is we'll get into in a second\nand it's actually setting up\nand it's actually setting up the uh our\nconfiguration files in the code. Now, I\nknow it's a lot of steps, but it's just\nhow it is. So, now let's figure out\nwhere exactly do we put the Google\nservice.json JSON for Android and where\ndo we actually put the Google service\ninfo.p list for uh iOS.\nNow I'm going to show you exactly how to\nconfigure uh basically your Google\nservice JSON file where where exactly to\nput it to get your project to work\nproperly for Android. For Android it's\nrelatively simple. All you have to do is\nbasically make sure you run a Android\nbuild development build. So you do this\nby npx expo run Android. I already ran\nthis, but when you run this, it will\nbasically create an Android folder in\nyour project. So, you just want to make\nsure you go over here and inside the app\nfolder, then you drag in the uh Google\nservices.json file that uh you\ndownloaded from Firebase. And again, I\ncan show you again where exactly to find\nthis file. And\nit is simply in your Firebase settings.\nSo, if you properly configured this, you\nwill go to your Android app right here.\nand you should be able to download over\nhere. For the iOS app, the iOS file will\nbe downloadable over here. But uh let's\nget back to the project. So once you\ndrag it in, you just have to make sure\nthat the naming is correct. You actually\ncannot name it anything other than that\nbecause we're not declaring a location.\nIt is literally only looking for this\nfile with this exact naming. So you want\nto make sure there's no like dash\none-ash2. Otherwise, your code will not\nGoogle authentication will just not work\nfor Android. So this is all you need to\nliterally set up authentication for\nAndroid. And the only thing is just make\nsure that when you do the Google\nconfiguration that I showed you earlier,\nyou don't just include the web and iOS\nsignin codes. You also include the one\nfor Android, which will be there if you\nproperly set it up in if you properly\nset up the Android project in Firebase.\nNow, for iOS, it is relatively more\ncomplicated purely because you can't\njust drag and drop it into VS Code. You\nwant to make sure you properly add uh\nthe uh Google service.p file to your\nproject. That means you need to add it\nthrough Xcode. And we will do that right\nnow. And I'll show you what it looks\nlike. But basically, when you open your\nproject with Xcode, you do not want to\nopen the whole thing. You want to\nspecifically open this iOS folder. And\nthat's because this iOS folder contains\nthe folders that have that are probably\nconsidered uh configured to be opened by\nXcode and actual runnable code by Xcode.\nSo, uh you want to make sure that when\nyou open the project, it is uh\nspecifically this iOS folder, which is\nexactly what I just opened right now.\nAnd then and please uh in my X code\nplease completely ignore the widget\nconfiguration stuff that has nothing to\ndo with this but what you want to do\nthen is add click add files to death\ncounter and here you will just drag and\ndrop your downloaded Google service uh\ninfo.p IP list and just here you have to\nmake sure to select the your app your\ntarget here and that is literally why we\nuse XOS otherwise we wouldn't be able to\ndo this in VS code as you can just drag\nand drop again same thing as Android the\nnaming is really important here so this\nshould not be named -7 it should just be\nGoogle service infoP list you can see I\nalready have one so I'm obviously not\ngoing to name this one the same thing\nand I'm going to delete this right now\nbut this is the configuration and\nliterally the only configuration that\nyou need to do but obviously you want to\nmake sure that target membership does\nsay death counter or like the name of\nyour app otherwise it will not work.\nOkay,\nnow let's go on to the next steps and\nactually let's test it. Let's test this\nright before to make sure that\neverything is working as it should. And\nso let's run npx expose start and then\nlet's run this on you know iOS to make\nsure it's working.\nAll right, so our code works and let's\ntest and it should actually work for\nGoogle. So because we configured our\nnaming in Google Cloud Console, this\nshould work properly and it will work\nproperly. So we get the pop-up, which\nmeans we're properly connected to the\nGoogle servers. Let's make sure it\nloads. I sign in with my email or sign\nup if I don't have an account yet. And\nthen I'm taken to the next page, which\nmeans it worked perfectly. So we're good\nto go. So what are the next steps? And\nlet me just go over what we've done\nuntil now. Right. So I've we've walked\nthrough how to set up the onboarding\npages. We allow users to authenticate.\nSo you can be missy authenticate, sign\nup to your app, go through all the\nonboarding and then we have all the data\nthat we collected about them. So the\nnext thing we want to do is actually do\nstuff with the data which uh is actually\nwhat users will be paying for, right?\nThey're paying for this specific product\nis a product that allows you to live\nlonger. They were specifically paying\nfor the calculations that we're doing in\nthe back end and to basically create a\ncustom routine for them to actually live\nlonger, which is what we're promising to\nthem. Also, small side note, you see\nthese files here, Google service info.p\nthose are not supposed to be there. I\njust added those um by mistake. So, I I\nI can actually delete those, right? I\ncan actually delete those right now. It\nwon't actually affect anything. Anyways,\nuh the next things to do are the payw\nwall, the calculation part, and the main\npages. And then at the end, we'll add a\ncheck to the to the landing page to make\nsure that if the user already paid,\nthey're obviously directed to the main\npage and don't have to go through all\nthe onboarding again. And yeah, that's\nthe main thing. And also, I'll add in a\nfew tips about things that it's actually\nwhat we're going to do right now. The\nnext thing is things that will help us\navoid unnecessary rejections by app\nstore. Add small things like adding your\nprivacy policy or terms of service to\nlike the main page and the payw wall. So\nwe'll do that first. It's a really small\nthing and we'll use claw to help us with\nthat. And then next step we're going to\nconfigure the payw wall and add those as\nwell. We're going to set up payments and\nthen after that we're going to get into\nthe backend calculations. This is all\nrelatively simple. Again, right now\nbecause of AI, like the barrier for\nentry for the actual technical challenge\nis getting lower and lower. So, this is\nactually going to get easier and easier.\nLike right now, a lot of the code that\nyou see here is written by AI and you\nshould let AI write it because why would\nyou waste your time writing it, right?\nSo, it's all about like actually\nunderstanding the idea and being able to\nbuild really quickly, which you know,\nwe're not at the point yet where I can\nask you build a whole app and it does it\nand the app is like ready to go. So\nthere's still a lot of stuff that you\nneed to understand and\nbut still uh it's uh just something that\nyou should know. So now let's try to uh\noptimize our landing page payw wall.\nThen we'll do the calculations the main\npages and then we'll set up our uh\nactual payment checking system. So\nhere's exactly what we're going to I'm\ngoing to show you exactly how I host my\nprivacy policy and terms of service\nbecause the most uh really the easiest\nway to do it is to host them online and\nthen just make it a link to and then\njust make it a link basically on the uh\non the actual pages. So I'll show you\nhow I do it with GitHub and then uh I\nwill just ask cloud to basically link\nthem and displaying in a nice way. So\nit'll basically do the hard work for us\nin terms of the UI. So let's set up the\nprompt. Let's make sure that this is\ndone.\nprivacy policy and terms of service and\nmake\nsure they are hyperlinks that direct to\nand then we'll we'll put the links here\nright so this is exactly what I do so\nwe'll go to my repositories but I\nbasically have a project called uh\nhighptt privacy policy and this is\nactually where I host all of mine it's\nthe name of the name of one project. I\nget the PDFs and then I host them with\nGitHub pages which is a really nice\nservice which allows you to host things\nfor free because we don't need a custom\ndomain for these files. So they're just\nhosted at this link and all I have to do\nis basically go to the\nmain page actually has a 404 because\nit's not set up. So all I have to do\nthen is that to actually just go to the\nPDF link for the for that. So, I made a\nfolder for uh legal legal stuff for this\nproduct and yeah, I'll drag and drop the\nstuff in here and then I'll show you\nexactly how to host them. So, I just\ndownloaded our privacy policy. So, then\nall I do now is actually just upload the\nfile here and it will automatically host\nit at the custom link that is hosted\nwith GitHub pages and then I will be\nable to find it. It'll take a couple\nminutes to actually like deploy\nobviously. And I'll make sure to also\ndownload the terms of service. And the\nonly thing is that I make sure the\nnaming is all in one line so that the\nURL is like relatively simple and not\nlike something with crazy symbols, which\nis what happens when you have spaces in\nthe name. But other than that, it's\npretty pretty simple. And to set up\nGoogle pages, all you have to go do is\ngo here, follow the settings, basically\nselect the branch, and it it's really it\nis really easy to deploy. And here it\nwould tell you the link. And if you\nwanted to, you could also attach a\ncustom link, which we won't do because\nit's not necessary and uh Apple doesn't\nactually care about that. So, right now,\nlet's attach the terms of service as\nwell. So,\ndeath counter uh terms\ndeath counter terms. PDF and we can also\nupload this as well. And it will be live\nvery soon. And then we can ask claw to\nthen attach the proper link. So\nyeah, this will be the link for\nokay. So it should be okay. What do we\ncall these files? We call them\ndeathcounter terms.pdf. So\nand the other link will be\nshould be deathcounter privacy.pdf.\nPDF\nthat counter privacy policy.\nAll right.\nNow give me the full updated code.\nOkay. So we see how quad actually\nwhen users click on here they're taken\nto the right link which then shows them\nthe either terms of service or the\nprivacy policy file depending on uh what\nexactly they clicked on. So yeah very\nsimple thing and will help you avoid\nissues with Apple reviewers as well. And\nnow let's actually move on to\nimplementing the payw wall uh\nfunctionality. So actually the how do we\nactually get the payments to properly\nwork. So let's do that. And this, just\nto give you a preview, this will require\nwork on both Google Play Store and uh\nApple um\non the Apple um connect app store\nconnect settings as well because to\ncreate the subscriptions, we need to uh\nactually create them there and then call\nthem from the code. But I'll go uh into\ndepth into this uh as well. So let's get\nstarted. Now to actually implement the\npayw wall we will take the same approach\nthat we did for uh basically\nother products sorry the other pages of\nour app and we will basically just ask\nclaude please give me the code for the\nUI given that it's relatively simple\neither way we'll have to make some\nadjustments regardless but uh still uh\nwe'll ask for the UI and do not worry\nabout the prices because these will be\nactually dynamically loaded so we'll\nhave to edit the code so they're\nproperly loaded dynamically but for now\nwe'll just use placeholders\nSo once uh Claude is done with that, so\nlet's ask it uh please generate\nthe code for my payw wall.tsx\nthat is part of my react native app.\nMake sure\nmatches that\nof the uh uploaded screenshots.\nscreenshot.\nAll right. So, we'll just it'll save to\ndownloads and then we'll just drop it in\nhere and it'll give us a code for the\npayw wall.tsx.\nAnd then in the meantime, you want to\nmake sure that you're logged into App\nStore Connect. So, this is exactly how\nuh you set up subscriptions for your\napp. So, you want to make sure to go\nthis obviously depends on the type. So,\nif you have onetime payments, it it\nmeans it's an inapp purchase. If you\nhave a recurring thing, it is a\nsubscription. So, keep that in mind. And\nso for inapp purchase you set them up\nhere. So onetime things and for\nsubscription you set them up here. Very\nsimple thing but good to know. And what\nyou need to do here is basically create\na new subscription. So you understand\num this mean that you understand\neverything. Let's say let's say test\nsubscriptions. So this is a subscription\nuh test subscription group. And this is\nwhat we're going to do uh here. So\nbasically we're just what we're going to\nhave to do is create a\nso once we actually uh create the\nsubscription group then we'll actually\ntake care of creating the subscription\nand for the subscription uh reference\nname uh you can just choose anything\nlike yearly subscription\nand what really matters here is the\nproduct ID. So usually you want to\nchoose something that uh is following\nyour app bundle ID. So for example for\nmine G call the GM455\nyearly subscription\ndeath uh counter and then you would\nactually create a subscription. So here\nthe main thing to make sure of is\nobviously you have to note this down\nbecause this is what we're going to be\ncalling in the code. And here you just\nhave to make sure you're filling out all\nthe details. So it's yearly so set the\nsubscription duration. Availability is\njust every country. We want it to be\navailable in every country really.\nsubscription price. Let's say we're\ncharging, I don't know, $59.99 per year.\nAnd\nthis will show just show you the\nsettings how it adapts to each country's\ncurrency. And you can actually hand\nchange these to play around with like\npricing and see if it affects\nconversions. So definitely feel free to\ndo that. Then confirm. It'll set that\nup. And then you have to set\nlocalization. And\nbasically, this is what shows up when\nthey actually try to pay. So, yearly\nsubscription,\nsubscription,\ndeath counter. Here we're just going to\nput description.\nThis is a little bit too long. You see\ndescription description. Either way,\nthis is a test. This is just a test. But\neither way, it's going to work if you\nactually set it up for for production.\nLike this is going to work in production\nas well. I'm just setting tests for the\nsake of this video because I already set\nthem up earlier. And here, this part is\nreally interesting. So, this can be any\nimage. Usually I usually put my app's\nlogo with the name of the subscription\nunder it. So here it will be like the\napp's logo with like yearly under it\nbecause they do these do have to be\ndifferent for each subscription\nstrangely enough even though it's just a\nimage that shows up when you pay and\ndoesn't actually affect anything. And\nwhat you need to show here is basically\nwhat's going to show up after uh the\nusers pay. So your viewers just have to\nmake sure that after the payment the\nusers are taken to the right page. They\nknow that the payment was actually\nsuccessful if that makes sense. So save\nthat. Make sure you fill all that out.\nOtherwise, if you don't, it'll say\nmissing metadata, which is actually\nmeans that you can't submit your\nsubscriptions and so Apple can't\nactually review them. So, make sure this\nis not the case. So, make sure you\nupload everything for that. So, um the\nlogo for subscription and a screenshot\nof what it's going to look like after\nusers pay, which is usually just the\nhomepage of like the main pages, which\nin this case would be\nuh this page. So, that's all I would\nupload. And then, yeah, and then you're\nset. you would make another\nsubscription. Uh let's say monthly\nmonthly subscription.\nI'm going to set the ID to\ncom dot my developer name. Uh and then\nlet's say monthly subscription\ndeath counter.\nOnce that's set, we'll set the duration,\nmonthly availability, availability. Then\nwe'll set the price. Let's say monthly\nwe're doing, let's say we're doing\n$12.99 right there. Then we'll go to the\nnext step and it'll all be set up. So,\nwe confirm and then we'll be good to go.\nAnd then let's make sure we fill out all\nthis. So, which I will take care of, but\nobviously you guys have to make sure\nyou're actually doing that as well as\nthe localization settings. So, monthly\ndescription\nand you're ready to go as long as you\nfill out everything else. And then now\nthat we have these set up, all we need\nto do in our code is actually just pull\nfrom these to get the dynamically loaded\nprices depending on the country. And\nyeah, other than that, it's it that's\npretty much it on the side of the\nNow, how do we actually create then\nthese subscriptions on Google Play\nStore?\nSo, I would show you this for\nspecifically the death counter app, but\nthere's a few things that you need to\nknow when uploading to Google Play\nStore. First of all, I mean the sections\nwhere you should do it are the monetize\nwith play and here it's the same\nstructure as uh the app store connect\nwhere you can upload both inapp products\nwhich is onetime purchases where you can\ncreate inapp products which is onetime\npurchases and subscriptions which is\nrecurring purchases. And but the thing\nyou need to know is you actually can't\nupload anything\nSorry.\nThe thing you need to know is that you\nactually can't create anything unless\nyou already have a internal testing\nbuild uploaded. And we don't have an\ninternal testing build uploaded yet for\nuh death counter, which is why I'm\nshowing this um to you for another app.\nSo, but either way, for death counter,\nonce you actually create the um the\ninternal testing build, you'll be\nactually just have to do this for for\nthat. So\nvery simple, very straightforward, same\nthing as app store connect where\nbasically the most important thing is\nthat for the product ID you make sure to\nuse\nagain this is not required it's just\ngood practice you make sure to use your\ndeveloper or like developer account\nthese are GM455\ndot then we say death counter\ndeath counter and then let's say yearly\nsubscription\nwe create a subscription right here and\nthen uh submission and benefits isn't\nnecessarily necessary to add, but you\nwould just say like they get full access\nto every feature that we have. Then you\ncreate a base plan ID here. I'm going to\nsay let's say it's yearly. So I'm going\nto say yearly plan right here.\nYearly plan right here. I'm going to say\nit's auto renewing. Uh it renews uh\nyearly since it's a yearly subscription.\nAnd then I'm gonna decide that the price\nis going to be let's say uh $59.99 just\nlike we said it in Apple. So once that's\nset, you're good to go. And all that you\nactually need is to memorize the not\neven the base plan ID. Just make sure to\nactivate it obviously once it's\ncompleted which is something that is\nactually different from the app store.\nAnd then here then you just have the\nproduct ID that you actually need to\nneed to memorize and put in your code.\nAnd that's all that you need to do. So\nyou then you create you'll use the same\nprocess to then create a monthly\nsubscription for your product. So now\nlet's actually dive in into actually how\ndo we actually make this work? How do we\nmake payments work within our actual app\nand so that users can actually make\npurchases with real money.\nSo let's let's uh get into the code.\nAll right. So let me walk you through\nexactly how the payment works for React\nNative. So, first of all, I copy pasted\nthe code that Claude gave me\nfor the payw wall page. And obviously,\nthis needs some UI enhancements, but it\nlooks pretty good right now. And sort of\nmatches the style that we had in the in\nthe Figma design. And yeah, so for the\npayw wall, we usually kind of take the\nsame approach that we take to our ideas.\nUh we try to go after like validated\ndesign. So pay wall that pay walls that\nwe know will actually convert. And so\ninstead of like trying to come up with\nsomething new and different and hope\nthat it works. And this is the reason\nwhy we don't actually need to use like\nsuper wall or revenue cat or any\nalternatives because we know that our\npayrolls are going to convert at least\nin terms of structure as long as like\nthe product value is there. And the\npackage we're using is react native AP\nwhich is important in a very specific\nway. In order to install it, you just\nrun npx start and then uh this package\nright here. It doesn't actually require\nany other configuration which is\nactually what's so great about it. And\nnow we everything we did up until now\nfor setting up the sub subscriptions on\napp store, Google play store comes into\nplay right now. So we basically have a\num variable for the product IDs that\ndepends on iOS and Android, right?\nAnd depending on that then uh the\nproduct ids match. Obviously it's always\ngood practice to make them the same\nacross as long as like the plan matches\nif that makes sense. Uh but then there's\ntwo parts to the actual\npayment. Something I want to cover first\nis the success model. So because users\nare paying for your service, it's\nusually good practice, good programming,\nand good design practice to show them\nsome kind of success message when they\ncomplete the payment. So that users\naren't just taken to the random page on\nyour website when they actually complete\nthe payment, which is why we have this\nmodel. And so makes it really easy when\ntesting because if you see the model,\nyou know it's working. If you don't see\nit, you know, you know it's not working.\nAnd\nyeah, this is test mode we used. And\nthen let's actually get into the payw\nwall screen itself. There's two parts\nwhich is the initialization of React\nNative IP which is inapp purchases and\nthe other part is the um related to the\nthe actual purchase handling. So making\nsure we can get the purchase from um\nfrom Apple or Google Play Store.\nSo, something I also want to make sure\nthat you remember is that in order to\nget this to properly work, we actually\nhad to enable uh for Apple particularly\num inapp purchase capabilities, which is\nsomething that obviously it won't work\nif you didn't enable that, but we\nalready went through that. Just a\nreminder. And if you wanted to enable\nthis, you can actually do it through\nXcode as well. But it is always best to\ndo it very early on like I did before uh\nand like I showed you guys how to do. So\nwhat you'll notice through this code,\nsomething that I always do and I'm very\ncareful with is console logs because\nthis is a multi-step process and I think\nmulti-step is an understatement. Like\nthis is actually is so much code to get\nthe payment working and uh depending on\nlike even like what AI tools you use to\nassist you through this process. This is\nnot easy. This is not easy to set up.\nIt's usually takes days to actually get\nit working. at least from my experience\nand I've built a ton of apps so and I\neven when I copy and paste the code\nsomething something ends up going wrong\nthere's some configuration issue so\nthat's why we have a ton of um console\nlogs so we identify the issue a lot more\neasily instead of having like an empty\ncode where you just have to guess what's\nactually what's actually going wrong if\nthat makes sense and there's a few parts\nof this right so first of all the first\nthing you need to do is actually create\nthe connection with react native inapp\npurchases and\nthen you have to start listening for\npurchases which is uh the listening for\npurchases is on two sides right so first\nof all there's a side that's connected\nto apple and there's a side that's\nconnected to uh actually like the UI so\nyou have to make sure that when the\nbutton is clicked then you actually uh\nthis actually leads to the\ninitialization of the inapp purchase\nfeatures and\nso what it looks like is when you\nactually click the button the method\nthat's called is not actually initialize\nIP right away but the method to actually\nhandle uh the purchase and what happens\nhere is that as soon as the purchase is\ncreated, we're pulling the product ids\nand then we're going to actually start\ncalling uh the other methods that um\nwill actually get the purchase started.\nAnd for good practice as well for the to\nactually make sure that you're\nconnecting properly to the app store. Uh\nyou want to make sure you want to always\nlog the purchases that are received\nwhich is why you request the\nsubscriptions and the to and bically ask\nApple to show me all the data that you\nhave stored. So that way if there's any\nissue for example if you mess up\nsomething like you put in the wrong\nproduct ID if since you're logging all\nthe purchases found in Apple then at\nleast then you'll know okay the issue is\nuh related to that and uh I would need\nto fix some configuration in um in Apple\nand all this is again the same thing\nthat happened for you know Google and uh\nGoogle authentication app authentication\nthis is not code like you're expected to\nmemorize in any way this is usually\nreusable code but that is uh obviously\nslightly\nuh quite a bit complicated actually. So,\nand let's say and it actually works\nslightly different for iOS and Android,\nwhich is why we're configuring it two\ndifferent ways. So, here we're basically\nchecking for what platform we're on,\nwhether we're on iOS or Android, and it\nthe purchase will be handled differently\ndepending on that. So, users are on iOS,\nwe'll request the subscription, which\nmeans we'll ask Apple, please give me\nthe subscription from the app store. And\nwe're passing in the product ID so that\nit knows exactly which one I want. And\nuh it actually, you know, I'm able to\nactually make the purchase. And for\nAndroid, it's handled slightly\ndifferently\nin terms of in terms of structure\nbecause you need to usually you need to\npass in an offer token. And if you don't\ndo that, payments usually do do not\nwork. And so that's something to keep in\nmind. And then also something that I\nreally want to mention that's really\nimportant is your app will actually get\nrejected always if you don't have a\nrestore purchase functionality. And\nrestoring purchases is actually uh\nreally really simple to set up. It's\njust means that and what it means is\nthat if I buy another iPhone and I'm\nlogged in with my Apple ID. I want to\nmake sure I don't have to pay for the\nsame app again. And this is something\nthat Apple's really strict with as well\nas they cancel my subscription button.\nSo those are things you need to have in\nthe apps if you actually want to get\napproved by Apple. Android is not as\nstrict, but they're really strict with\nother things, which is also kind of\nfrustrating, but we'll go over that in\nthe submission section uh as well. So,\nthis is the method right here that\nhandles actually restoring purchases.\nAnd this is kind of uh kind of the same\napproach as the other code where it's\nrelatively uh complicated code that you\ndon't necessarily need to\nmemorize. It's just something that you\nuse once and then you could copy and\npaste. And if you guys obviously you\nguys can take a screenshot and use this\nfor your own projects. And all of this\nkeep in mind was built and developed\nwith the you know with the assistance of\nuh you know LLM models because of how\ncomplicated is and especially like uh\nwith debugging um and setting all the\nconsole logs basically. But the main\nidea is I ask Apple to give me the\nsubscriptions. Then depending on which\none I'm actually going for and which one\nI actually want to purchase, I make the\nrequest. Apple gives it back to me and\nthen I can actually make the payment.\nNow I would love to test this on a\nsimulator and something that it's really\ngood for you guys to know so that you\ndon't waste time is that uh for this\nspecific package react native AP it's\nactually very unreliable when it comes\nto testing on a simulator. So you should\nalways do it on uh test flight. So what\nI always do is I always push a version\nto test flight to make sure that payment\nis working or is not working. And when\nit's not working I just make sure to\nshow the error on my uh test flight\nscreen because right now if I were to\ntest it it wouldn't work even though\nit's on on a simulator. it wouldn't work\neven though it is actually properly\nconfigured. So that's a bit of the\nfrustrating part.\nThen we can also add promo code\nfunctionalities. These are actually\nrelatively simple\nbecause Apple allows you to set these up\nin uh in there in their in the actual\napp store even though we won't go over\nthat in here. But yeah, that's something\nreally important to keep in mind. Now uh\nthe only the most important thing is not\nactually getting the payment to work but\nactually memorizing that the user\nalready paid. And there's a few\ndifferent ways to do it. So for Apple,\nit's relatively easy because it's\nconnected to their Apple account. So uh\nthere's literally a oneliner we can use\nto check if the account has made a\npayment to our app before. However, it\nis good practice to also store that\nlocally and make sure that we know that\nthe user has paid, right? Which is why\nwe use async storage to make sure that\nuh basically save whether the user has\num access and should be able to use the\napp completely for free, especially\nsince it's a hard payroll app. So, this\nis exactly what we're doing on this\nline. And this uh obviously you'll see\nhow it depends on promo codes as well.\nThis is because if users were to have a\npromo code, we want to make sure they\nhad access through a promo code because\nsome promo codes expire, for example,\nthings. So, we want to make sure we're\nkeeping track of all of this locally as\nwell because you never know if someone\nlogs out of their uh of their Apple\naccount then does that mean they don't\nget to use the app anymore because we're\nchecking for that if that Apple account\nhas completed a payment. So that see\nthat's relatively unreliable which is\nwhy we need to use async storage and\nstore all the data locally. This is also\nbecause as I'll explain later on the\nmain page where we want to decide\nwhether we should redirect them to the\num main functionality or just have them\ndo the onboarding again. We want to\ncheck for a variable that tells us\nwhether they paid or they didn't pay. So\nthat's why we need to do that as well.\nAnd yeah those are the main things that\nyou need to know. I have to say this is\na relatively complex setup for the um\nthe payment screen, but it's something\nthat's necessary to do. Obviously, the\nmain things that you need to know is\nthat you need to properly initialize\ninapp purchases. You need to properly\nhave it uh configured as capabilities if\nyou're using Apple. For Android, there's\nactually nothing to do on that end. And\nfor Androids, you just need to make sure\nyou're passing the offer token to the\nhandle purchase method. And then yeah\ninitialize inapp purchases um handle\nactually handle the purchases and then\nuh set the data locally knowing that\ntells us whether the user actually\ncompleted the payment or not and then\nredirect them and you can redirect them\neither through a modal like we like to\ndo um with the apps we build or you can\njust redirect them directly even though\na modal does help a lot with the\nexperience. All right. So, how does\nsubmission to the both App Store and\nGoogle Play Store work? Especially if\nyou're building with React Native. It is\na bit different than Xcode uh when\nyou're building with Swift, especially\nfor Apple, because with Xcode, you can\njust automatically submit with like a\ncouple of buttons and it's already\nintegrated into the actual app, but it's\na bit different for React Native. So,\nwhat you usually use is uh the EAS CLI,\nwhich basically allows us to both create\nuh create a new build. So if you wanted\nto test a build locally or for example\ninstall it on my phone uh without using\nExpo Go for example, you could do that.\nUh but also EAS is what's really nice is\nit builds it remotely and allows you to\nalso automatically submit to your Apple\naccount and automatically uh connects to\nit.\nSo let's clear the terminal and actually\nlike uh install make sure that we have\nthe ES EAS CLI installed. And in order\nto actually submit builds, uh the really\nimportant thing is that you need to have\nan EAS\num.json\nfile, which basically tells uh your code\nwhat settings to build to build with uh\nwhen we actually, you know, try to\ncreate a new build. So you'll see how I\nalready have a ES. EAS.json. Uh, but the\nmost important things here is to make\nsure you have a build set up for\nproduction, which is really most of the\ntime you only use a build for that. And\num, in order to do EAS builds, you have\nto make sure you have an account at\nexpo.dev. So make sure to do that. Just\nas a little bit piece piece of advice\nthat builds do take a while unless you\nare willing to pay which is very\nfrustrating because especially for Apple\nit can take almost two hours for a build\njust because there's a lot of people\npushing at the same time and they just\nwant to make money so they charge you\nunfortunately. And um yeah once you have\nyour account and you have the ES CLI\ninstalled then feel free to run EAS init\nwhich will basically uh initiate the EAS\nprocess. You'll have to go through like\na few onboarding steps. You can go\nthrough it again even though it is\nalready set up on my on my device which\nthe project is already linked but all\nit's going to ask you is going to take\nyou to the expo dev site which is then\ngoing to ask you to basically verify\ntheir account your account and this is\nall just to make sure that the account\nis linked and you're pushing to the to\nthe right place so that you can actually\ndownload the builds. So something that's\nreally important for this is to\nunderstand uh how builds work\ndifferently from iOS and Android. For\niOS, it's usually IPA format, whereas\nfor Android, it'sAB\nusually. And\nfor Android, usually you'll have to\nbasically create a build with EES, then\ndownload it, and then manually upload to\nGoogle Play Store. For um iOS, there's\nactually a command where it\nautomatically submits it, which is\nreally, really nice.\nSo, when I want to create a new build\nfor iOS, for example, this is exactly\nwhat I would do. So, I would run ES\nbuild. You see it I'm telling it to\ncreate a new build for production and\nthat's exactly what's happening. And\nit's asking me do I want to log in with\nmy Apple account. Yes. I select the\nApple account. I select the company that\nI am particularly um you know that I'm\nworking for like the company is uh\nbasically I'm just selecting the Apple\ndeveloper account since I have I'm\nconnected to three different accounts.\nUh would you like to reuse your\nprovisioning profile? Yes. And then the\nbuild will usually start at this exact\npoint. But the only issue is that you\nmight end up in a queue in like um which\nis a little bit frustrating and it will\ntake a while. But you'll have this link\nand that's the same exact thing that\nwill happen when you build for Android.\nAnd if you wanted to build for Android,\nall you would have to change is that one\nletter here. You would change this to\nAndroid and not iOS.\nOkay. So let's let's check on our our\nbuild's progress. So this is what the\nexpo.dev will look like. Let's make sure\nwe're actually logged in to expo.dev so\nwe can actually uh test this out.\nand we go to our app right here and\nwe'll see how we have a build running\nright here. So once the build is\ncompleted, we'll be able to download a\nIPA file. But we don't actually want to\ndo that because once the build is\ncompleted, we can actually push to uh\nwe can actually push to uh Apple\nimmediately using this the submit button\nwith EAS.\nAnd what is the command to actually do\nthat? It's EAS submit. So all you have\nto do is copy and paste this into the\nconsole and then it's going to\nautomatically submit to the app store.\nSo while um the build is running in the\nbackground, I'll walk you through\nexactly how uh basically app store\nsubmission works. So first of all, you\nhave to make sure you have everything\nfilled out like over here uh promotional\ntext subscription. This is very\nrelatively simple, really hard to mess\nup. Just make sure you have a privacy\npolicy and you're hosting it somewhere.\nAnd I already showed you how to host it.\nAnd what's going to happen is once you\nsubmit a build, it's going to show up\nright here. And all you have to do is\nselect the build and uh you're good to\ngo if you wanted to add it for review.\nAnd there's three different uh types of\nstatus for your app. So it's going to be\nprepare for submission, um ready to\nsubmit, uh waiting for review, and then\napproved or rejected. Um but yeah,\nthat's relatively simple. And here this\nthis question is pretty important. So\nfor an app like this where it requires\nauthentication uh Apple always requires\nfor you to input like sample credentials\nthat you can basically play around with\nuh so that uh you're properly like\nsigned in to your product and and they\ndon't have to create their own accounts.\nAnd this is so that they can just play\naround with it without uh you know le I\nguess leaking their credentials. So it's\nreally important for a product like this\nI would create like a tester account. I\nusually just make it like\ntester@gmail.com\nand then a random password. And then I\ntell them right here, um,\nthis is a tester account\nthat will give you access\nto all features. And then you put in\nyour contact information right here. And\nthat's that's something that's really\nimportant to do. And the other thing\nthat is really crucial for app store\nsubmission is subscriptions because\nunlike Google play store. So you have to\nexplicitly submit subscriptions and\ninapp purchases. So how do you do that\nright and once you actually have your\nitem uploaded I will show you exactly\nhow to do that but basically you just\nhave to attach them to do your product.\nAnd now uh something that will very\neasily get your app rejected is also\nissues around data collections age\nrating and things like that. that. So\nyou have to make sure that you fill out\nthis information accurately. For\nexample, if it's a gambling app or\nthings like that, you have to do your\nlegal research about like uh the first\nof all the legality of it, but also uh\nwhat you need to declare uh whether you\nneed to check uh for a user's age in app\neven outside of like the download uh the\nApple download\nuh like age restriction. And yeah, these\nare the main settings that you need to\nmake sure if you know that you're\noperating in sort of a gray area as\nwell.\nSo, how does it work for Google Play\nStore and how different is it? So, I'll\nshow you exactly uh how it works and\nit's actually quite quite different\nespecially when it comes to\nsubscriptions. So, I mentioned earlier\nthat in order to actually test\nsubscriptions and create them, you need\nto create a build for internal testing.\nSo, this is what you need to do. You\nneed to create a new release for\ninternal testing before you actually\ncreate a production release. And what\nyou're going to do is run the command\nthat I told you to run, which is EAS\nbuild. It's the command right here.\nOkay, our build failed, but we'll we'll\nfigure out why that happened later. But\nthe command that you need to run to\ncreate a Android build is exactly this\none.\nAnd once you run that command, it's\ngoing to take you again to a page just\nlike this, which will have a hopefully a\nsuccessful build where you can actually\ndownload a file called dot with a\nextension.AB AAB and you're then going\nto upload this file right here and it's\ngoing to process it. Tells you if\nthere's any like configuration errors or\nsomething like that and then you create\na release name. So, for example, release\none\none and then you save you save the build\nand then uh once you actually have an\ninternal testing build going, it's uh\nyou can actually set up subscriptions\nand you can actually test them properly.\nBut without one, you can't do that. Once\nyou're done with that, you have to\ncreate a new uh a new build for the\nproduction. And what you're going to do\ndo is basically upload it right here.\nAnd this one is actually the actual one\nthat should have first of all\nsubscriptions already tested. This is\nthe final version that you're actually\nsubmitting. And um yeah,\nso you can see how much easier it is to\nsubmit uh with EAS. And now let's\nactually try to debug.\nOkay, so we realized the error was\nrelated to our wager functionality,\nwhich is not something that we're going\nover in these videos, but um definitely\nnot something that's super important,\nbut the build will now it's now going to\nwork properly since we properly\nconfigured our pod file. Uh let's make\nsure we're signed up with our Apple ID\nand we should be good to go. So yeah,\nthis is really all you need to know. Uh\nthe main things that you need to keep in\nmind when submitting to uh to app store\nis to make sure that you have your your\nlegal stuff in place. And I will prepare\nyou uh and say that your app will like\n90% get rejected the first time you\nsubmit it. And it's usually small things\nlike forgetting to add like a restore\nyour subscription button, cancel my\nsubscription button, forgetting to add a\nsettings page for your app. Um, but it\nis definitely normal and they're pretty\nreceptive compared to Android Google\nPlay Store reviewers which take like\nseven days to get back to you which is a\nbit frustrating. Hello everyone. So\nwelcome to the marketing section and\ntoday we're talking about social media\nmarketing. So KAI again I use COI all\nthe time because they're you know very\nsuccessful in what they are doing. If\nyou look at the\ncontent that they're producing from from\nfrom their Instagram accounts, just take\na look.\nYou can see that a lot of the posts that\nthey're making are creatorled UGC\ncontent. There's a reason.\nLet's just take a look at this even in\ndifferent languages.\n[Music]\nJust a regular video.\n[Music]\nNot even like an advertisement yet. So\npeople just think it's a regular video.\nNot no plug at all.\n[Music]\nThis is taking a long time.\nFinally, they're using a video plug\nright here.\n[Music]\nThat was a very subtle plug-in. However,\nsee the views that this video actually\ngot. Videos that just promote your app\nlike crazy. like you like if the user\nand like the viewer know that the video\nis simply just a promo video, there's\nless retention rate. So, finding a\nreally good way to tweak your\nadvertisement in a video is extremely\nimportant. And Gabriel is going to go\nover this in his section. Right now,\nwe're focusing on how to find the right\ncreators to basically do paid promotion\non. Aside from organic content, you have\nto create or create like a document to\nstructure your, you know, your deal, but\nalso make sure the creators that you're\nreaching out to actually have views,\nright? So, for example, if I am a\ncompetitor of Cali, I'll simply go to\ntheir videos and click into the, you\nknow, like the creator a creator\nInstagram page. And you can clearly see\nthey're doing like a partnership right\nhere since a lot of the videos that\nthey're doing cowi\nand they also have a promo code going on\nwhich basically it's like an affiliate\nprogram in the deal structure. People\nwho enter code Andy gets a discount and\nalso Andy I assume his name is Andy.\nAndy would also get a cut of that. So it\nis in his incent it's it is incent he's\nincentivized to promote the app even\nmore since more people registering with\nthe code Andy would you know make him\nmore money right and I'll just go to his\nfollowing and then start looking for\npeople who are probably going to be in a\nsimilar niche see these are people who\ncan definitely do cowi advertisements\nwhich see he's actually doing it so\npeople hang out with people who are\nsimilar content creators ers hang out\nwith people who are also in the same\nniche in terms of content creating. So\nthat's definitely a way to go about it.\nIt really depends on the app that you're\nlooking for. But you can also see a\nsystem here where they would always\ncollaborate in terms of post. Why? One\nbecause this drives traffic to Cali,\nright? So people they see this instead\nof just a small like a very direct way\nof saying oh yeah you know which funnels\nin users into this page so they can\nactually check out the functionalities\nlike when they click on the page they\ninstantly see scan track improve very\nsimple and they understand how the app\nworks from the video itself. So the next\nstep obviously is just go to app store\nand download it. Right? They also have a\nsocial proof right here. It's a great\nway to structure your app where you have\ntestimonials, reviews, research, food\nscans, FAQ, which which makes it more\npersonalized and is looks like a very\ncredible app unless\nyou look at the Apple review where\npeople actually downloaded the app and\nthey were complaining that it was not\naccurate at all. Well, that's besides\nthe point because it got 1.5 billion\nusers. So you start finding creators and\nyou should just copy and paste whatever\nyou write in your draft. So just send it\nlike a standard draft. This is what we\nusually do. Hi, hi there. We like your\ncontent. So validation first and we want\nto do paid promo. We are building\nGPT and you can link it to Instagram\nwhich p is an app that predicts and\nmaximize your height.\nBasically, we had a folder of all the\nvideos that we have made. So, we we\nwould literally just share this folder\nwith them. So, I'll just get the link\nfrom here and it's going to be viewer\nonly, but they can download the video.\nSo,\nso we just make it clear it will involve\nyou posting videos from here or you can\ntell them if you want to tell them to\nmake their own videos. It's actually\nalso a good way, but it's just there's a\nlearning curve for them if they're not\nthat good of a creator of that specific\nniche product, right? Um, so this is\njust a way to assure quality without\nspending too much time. But also, you\nshould ask for usage rights. So, if they\nwere to make a video specifically for\nyour app, you should ask for the usage\nright u in part of the negotiation.\nSo, you could do paid promo, paid ads on\nInstagram or Facebook or even let other\npeople post it, right? And there are two\nways you could structure the deal. Pay\nper\npay per thousands of views, which I\npersonally don't recommend, and pay per\nview. We always do pay per. So, one\nvideo is x amount of money, 10 videos is\nx amount of money. It makes negotiation\na lot easier.\nYeah. So, I basically just structure it\nlike this. Hi there. We like your\ncontent. We built this. That does that.\nand let me know if you're Yeah. So, we\nhave the message and you just copy and\npaste it to all the people in the same\nniche. If you have a calorie tracker,\nsearch calorie tracker on Instagram and\nthey're going to find a lot of different\nfitness influencers. Or do go to like\nthe second circle of content, right?\nFitness influencers, vegetarian, I don't\nknow, nutritionist, like these\ninfluencers would probably have the\nright target audience for you. Now, in\nterms of pricing, it really depends, but\nI would definitely try. It depends on\ntheir you know likes and stuff like\nthat. But a general rule of thumb that\nwe use would be if average view average\nview of video is less than 50k then\nwon't go over $10. That's for us and it\nactually worked for us. A lot of\ncreators want to work with us. It is\nespecially true with theme pages where\nfaceless Instagram pages where you know\nfor example like a gym motivational\ncontent page that just reposts and\nrepurposes other content like you can\nget the prices really low on that point\nbut it's going to have the same target\naudience so those are like a untapped\ngold mine basically creators are\nexpensive a lot of prices a lot of these\ncreators are like they have super happy\ninflated prices since the creator\neconomy is very hot right now it's in\ndemand but I I just don't see a reason\nwhy you would go for a creator when you\nhave theme pages that are willing to do\nit for a lot less money. So this is the\nmarket rate. If it's over 50K 50, so\nlike let's say 50k to 150k, I won't go\nover $20, so on and so forth. definitely\ndepends on your risk tolerance level as\nwell since you're going to be doing\nconsistent promotions and ideally\nthey're posting like once every two days\nor something like that to ensure that\nyou know you're having consistent output\nconsistent exposure but also I would say\nset up the deal structure in which you\ndon't commit too much so you buy one or\ntwo videos first you test out the water\nand then if you like it then you can buy\nmore but also let's say you do a deal\nstructure of 10 or 20 videos at once.\nThat is a bargaining chip on your end\nsince you can say, \"Oh, I'm buying in\nbulk. Can you do a discount for me?\" If\nit's a $10 per video, you can say,\n\"Okay, I'll I'll buy 20 videos, but per\nvideo, decrease it from 10 to eight or\nseven. You get a good deal.\" Usually,\nthe payment structure will be structured\nas 50% upfront, 50% uh after. So, if I\nbuy 10 reels and it takes them 10 days\nto post them, I would personally pay\nthem around 30 to 40 for the first five\nvideos and after they post the first\nfive videos,\nthen I'll be like, \"Okay, now I'm middle\nof the deal.\" I took on the risk of you\nscamming me, right? Because a lot of\npeople, they can just take your money\nand go away. There's no way you can sign\na contract with every single theme page\nor every Instagram account that you're\ngoing to be doing promotion with. So,\nlet's just not do that. But it's\ndefinitely you're taking a certain risk,\nbut calculated risk since there's no\nreason for them to take your money and\nnot post your content since they would\nassume that you would give them more\ndeals, right? So, they wouldn't want to\nmess up the relationship anyways,\nthen I'll maybe pay them the remaining\n$50 after they posted all the videos or\nafter they finished the first section,\nthe first five videos. But definitely uh\nsell on the dream. like selling the\ndream that you're going to buy like 100\na h 100red different promotional videos\nso that they would feel like a long-term\npartnership with you is worth pursuing\nwhich is definitely the the case right\nif a video if a page is producing\nconsistent outcome for you in terms of\nviews there's no reason for you to not\nwork with them if that makes sense so\nthere's actually like you're actually\ngoing to be spending like money like\nbuying a 100 post on one Instagram page\nacross a span of 200 days maybe if\nyou're doing one post every twice every\ntwo case\nthere's no reason not to and is a very\ngood bargaining chip you can use during\nnegotiation also I would say the concept\nof optionality is very important as well\nwhy we were hiring editors for our short\nform content we posted on Instagram\nYouTube and just all the platforms\npossible we got a lot of applications\nwhat we did was I added everyone to a\ngroup chat and then I just tell them\nOkay, of course I did quality assurance,\nright? I like the the people I added to\nthe group chat are people who can\nprovide me the the video quality that I\nwanted in the first place. So of course\nlike their service assuming their\nservice is ideal to you. I tell them I\nhave x amount of other options. For\nexample, I have 10 other video editors.\nThey're giving me $5 per video. Like\nprice in terms of pricing, I only have\nto pay them $5 per video. You're telling\nme 10. There's no way I'm going to go\nwith you. You either load the price or\nseek out alternatives, which is true. If\nyou have more bargaining power on the\nmarket, you can decrease the price by a\nlot since the price decrease would be\nstemming from the fact that they need\nyou more than you need them. So, you\nhave higher bargaining power. Also, it's\nactually true. If you have five video\neditors and one is offering you like $2\nper video, there's no reason for you to\ngo with the one that is asking for $5\nper view assuming the quality like such\nas pair quality is the same but the\nprice is different, right? So you can\ntell them and you do a market\ncompetition where in your small market\nlike a five people like you do a market\nequilibrium and you find the low I mean\nnot equilibrium but you find the lowest\nprice point and you go with them and you\nestablish a long-term partnership. You\ncan reach out to 200 accounts easily in\nin a few hours just like sourcing them\nand DMing them. A lot of these accounts\nthey do restrict people to DM them so\nit's impossible to connect with them.\nI'm not sure how they get sponsored, but\nmaybe you can send out emails as well.\nThis is a good email format if you want\nto send it out. And yeah, you just if\nyou have 200 options that you send out\nto, I mean 200 people that you send like\na message to, most of them I would say\nbased off on my experience, it would be\naround 25 to 30% actually respond back\nto you. So 100 200 people\n30% of response rates that is 60 people.\nYou have 60 different options. There's\nno way you're going to be you know\npaying all 60. But that's bargaining\npower. The bargaining power that stems\nfrom optionality is something you don't\nwant to undermine.\nAlso a lot of these theme pages can also\ntell you that oh yeah there are also\nlike other apps or other products are\ngiving me way higher rates. What you\ntell them is you have other options. If\nif they don't want it, then bye-bye.\nDon't be scammed by their bargaining um\ntactic because for theme pages, the only\ncost associated from their end is the\nopportunity cost. Meaning they post your\npost so they can't post other brands\npost. But if they're not that filled up,\nmaybe they have like one other sponsor,\nthere's no reason why he can't like he\nor she can't post both both partners'\ncontent, if that makes sense. So, it's\njust going to be an additional gain if\nthe deal is finished and established. If\nnot, he's going to lose out on the\nentire deal and it is on their end that\nthey're losing. So understand that you\nhave a lot of negotiating power since\nyou're the one paying people\nand yeah that is basically how we reach\nout to influencers and theme pages.\nWe have accumulated around you know\nconsistently 10 million to 20 million\nviews on a weekly basis. So the best you\ncan do right now is to like definitely\nget the views up, but more importantly\nthe user interface design which is\ncovered in section two like the flow has\nto make sense to maximize the conversion\nrate, right? So even if if you have like\nthe worst product on earth, if you can\nget it to 50 million people, 100 million\npeople on a weekly basis or a monthly\nbasis, you're set since\nsince there are going to be people who\nbuy who going to buy it. if you have a\nlarge enough base number. So definitely\ngetting your content out there is is\nextremely important.\nI would also do a set budget for the\nfirst month of your app promotional\ncampaign because uh it's a it's really\neasy to go over the price point and most\nof these account would probably demand\nPayPal payments. So on PayPal payment\nthere are two options. One is you can\nselect you're sending money to your\nfriends and your family. Second is you\ncan select you're paying for goods and\nservices. So that definitely choose the\nsecond one. So the goods and services\nbecause you can retract your money if\nthey're not doing their work for a given\ntime frame. I forgot how many days, but\nalways choose good goods and services in\nyour PayPal payment. So you negotiate\nthe you draft this up. You send these\nmessages to 200 300 accounts on the on\nthe daily basis. Wait for them to text\nback and establish deals. You record it\non your spreadsheet or Google Doc,\nthings like that. and you send payment\nthrough PayPal and you all control it\nunder your budget. Also think keep in\nmind if you do a deal structure of 20\nvideos across\na month or or 20 days like definitely\ndon't go with posts deal structures\nwhere they say I'll post like five times\na day like that's going to decrease\ntheir reach since Instagram is probably\ngoing to punish them for posting five\ntimes a day. So it also like frequency\nmatters a lot, right? So, I would\npersonally recommend going with at most\none per day. This is what we do just to\nbalance out the um the algorithm, but\nalso we don't want to burn that much\ncash in the short amount of time.\nThis is it for negotiating and setting\nup deal structures and reaching out to\ncreators and uh basically all things for\npaid promotion. Thank you for watching\nand I'll see you in the next one.\nWelcome to the business model section of\nstarting your app startup. Now, this is\nthe business finance sheet that we have\nto keep track of our expenses. I know\nsome of you out there are probably like\nfinance people. Don't worry, I\nunderstand this is not the standard way\nto go about it. But since we're very\nsmart startup, there's really no point\nin, you know, making it complicated.\nonly only thing you have to know is\nrevenue equals\nprofit plus cost right so therefore this\nis a way for us to track the revenue and\ncost things like that from the business\nmodel that we have right here now let's\ntalk about business model first so app\nbusiness model um one of the best ones I\nalready told you guys before in the\nprevious section but subscriptionbased\nservice is probably one of the best\nbusiness model out there where you have\nreoccurring revenue on a monthly basis.\nSo we usually offer two options for\npeople either monthly and yearly or\nweekly and lifetime, right? And so this\nis the price that you can see right\nhere. Everything here will be a template\nthat you can find on the course page. So\nunder resources, I'm pretty sure, but\nyou could also it's already adjusted\nbased on your based on the reasoning of\nlike the the things you're going to need\nbasically. Like for example, if I say\n1,00 here, 10,000 paying users, it's\nit's going to it's going to\nautomatically calculate it for me.\nBusiness model. So yeah, usually\nconsumer social ads, they do some\nsomewhere around, you know, like the\nsingledigit dollar range. So $9.99,\n5.99, $4.99, 3.99, things like that. And\nyearly subscription, usually what they\ndo is to encourage people to go for the\nyearly option since, you know, they're\npaying like a bunch of fee upfront.\nthere's no cost on our end and it re it\nbasically eliminates the the need for us\nto worry about churning like user\nturnurning. Maybe they subscribe three\nmonths and they leave. That's bad,\nright? But if they pay for let's say 10\nmonths and we give them an extra two\nmonths to prevent them from turnurning\naway, that's actually good from a\nbusiness perspective. So usually would\nwe would lower the price for a yearly\njust so that it incentivizes people to\nbuy it buy that option. but also for\nweekly options and lifetime access,\nright? It's also like we're\nincentivizing people to buy lifetime\naccess so that we don't have to worry\nabout user turnurning\nand so that is definitely something we\nhave to tweak a bit. I'll also go into\nlike a deeper further example right\nthere. There are apps that goes weekly\nthey charge like $3.99 but to buy\nlifetime only costs like around $19.99.\nLike it's a very easy\ndecision to make based off of the this,\nright? Since um\nuh 3.99\nevery times three, which is cost per\nmonth is 11 something. So, you're paying\nlike one 1.3 1.4 months, but you get\nlifetime access. This is very appealing.\nAnd people are just going to be like,\nhey, $4 per week, that's $12 a month.\nI'd rather just buy lifetime. And that\nis something we want since as long as\nyou have a big enough funnel, meaning\nyou have enough views on social media,\nright? Like even if it's like the worst\nconversion on the earth, you're still\ngoing to make money. Now, this is the\nbusiness model. Reoccurring revenues are\nthe best and also the profit margins are\nextremely high. You have one upfront\ncost and the rest is about scaling it\nand it's basically pure profit. Of\ncourse, the only headache here is the\napp store 30% transaction fee. What What\ndo I mean by that? Now, if you hover\nover to the cost section, forming the\nLLC costed us $500 to get incorporated\nin Delaware through Stripe Atlas. App\nStore, you have a $99 upfront fee to\ncreate your Apple developer account. And\nit's going to take 30% off of your\nrevenue for each app sale. So, if you\nhave $100, if you make $100 in revenue\nfrom your app, you're getting $70 from\nthat. So as you can see on the back end\nyou know it's just a simple equation\nbasically basically 99 plus 30% of F11\nwhich is total revenue which I have\nright here and for total revenue we just\nadd up add up monthly subscription\nrevenue and yearly subscription revenue\nand it's a good projection and profit is\nsomething where you revenue minus cost\ntotal cost equals profit. So we just\nhave it automated here. So that if we\nlet's say we suddenly has a we have we\nsuddenly have like a 1k cost then it's\ngoing to instantly reflect on the final\nsheet. So whenever I hover on the sheet\nI just look at the final section so I\ncan understand you know what is\nperforming well what is performing bad\nand maybe you know we can adjust some of\nthe sections right here. Now these are\nplaceholder texts. These are true. These\nare all true. These are not true. We\nhave web hosting. Basically buying a\ndomain from GoDaddy, right? And domain\nhosting frameware website builder which\nwe used Google for a community which is\n$99 or $100 per month. Claude account\nobvious for obvious reasons to code the\napp. Also marketing spend. But yeah, you\ncould see these are probably like the\nall the events that you're pro you're\ngoing to encounter at least in the early\nstages of founding your company. And\nsince we're not really and no one's on\npayroll, so we don't really have to\nworry about employees. Of course, when\nyou're bootstrapping your company, the\nbest thing to do is just to build the\napp yourself. So this makes it so much\neasier. And the total comes down to this\nprice, assuming this price and we can\nproject our revenue, right? If we have\n500 users, we will make total profit of\n12K since I mean also this is assuming\nthat they don't churn, right? assuming\nthey're paying the full 12 12 months,\nbut you definitely have to add in churn\nrate, which you can only do after\nprobably a few months of having the app\npublished. So that's not that's not\nsomething we have to worry about right\nnow. But this should be adjusted based\non churn rate. For example, if churn is\nfor monthly subscription is about 50%.\nLet's just say 50%.\nThat means that when you multiply total\nrevenue per year, you probably have to\nadd another section that's that\nbasically times 0.5. So that um the\nyearly projection is not as much as\nthis, right? But yearly like the actual\nannual subscription revenue is rather\nstraightforward based off of years. And\nyou know, not going to lie, a lot of\npeople often forget that they're\nsubscribed to something. So after a\nwhole year, maybe they don't use the app\nat all, but they're still going to be\ncharged if they forget to cancel their\nsubscription. So that's also one thing\nfor sure.\nThis is basically the business model to\nconclude everything. Business model for\napps. You have weekly and lifetime, but\nalso uh monthly and annual options that\nyou could do on your payw wall. And like\nas you can see right here, like this is\nwhat we're doing, right? Weekly and\nlifetime, onetime payment, lifetime\npayment. Oh, I mean onetime payment and\nweekly payment. This is not finished,\nbut and also just put all your costs on\nthe sheet that we're going to be sending\nyou and you're good to go. Now, another\nthing is to consider very potential like\nburdensome cost would be lawyers\nassuming you're operating from the US\ncompany, you might want to hire a\nconsultant, legal consultant just to in\ncase that someone sues your company and\nthings like that, right? If you get your\napp out there to 100 thousand 100\nthousand people, there's probably going\nto be one or two people who are like\nextremely unsatisfied about your service\nand it is just the best if you first of\nall have a good privacy policy in terms\nof condition in place so that you have\nmore bargaining chip or you know defense\nsince they agree to the terms to use\nyour service to not get sued. But if\neven if you get sued, right, it's nice\nto have a legal consultant or just\nlawyers you're going to know you you\nknow that you can just reach out to and\npay a onetime fee and maybe figure\nthings out for you, right? So legal fees\nagain in New York, I did a fair share of\nresearch and it's probably about 2 to 3K\nor even more. So that's something you\nwant to consider. You want to consider.\nWe're fortunate enough to know a few\nlawyers so that we we definitely reduced\nquite a lot of costs on this end.\nJust make sure everything you're doing\nis legal. That's the thing. Yeah. Yeah.\nThis is basically the business model. If\nyou want to hire people, that's going to\nbe a lot more complicated. And you could\nalso work with people on a contractor\nbasis in which I'll also show you in the\nnext section called contractors.\nThank you for watching and I'll see you\nin the next one.\n>> Okay. Now let's talk about uh viral\ncontent marketing. So this is something\nthat you should be thinking about from\nthe start even before actually building\nthe product. And this is actually should\nbe something that is in consideration\nwhen actually choosing whether to work\non a product or not because content\nmarket fit matters a lot more than\nproduct market fit. You want to make\nsure that you be able to advertise your\nproduct\nand make sure you understand exactly\nwhat the best way to do that and most\neffective way to do that is. There's a\nlot of different ways to go about it and\nit really depends on what your product\nis. So for a product such as this one\nlike life clock life uh life sorry death\ncounter for example um you have to look\nat uh whether the product has inherently\nviral features. Any product you build it\nit has to have that thing where people\nlook at it and are somewhat and have\nsome sort of reaction out of it. And\nthere's two different products right?\nThere's a type of product where it's\nlike oh my god this product does\nsomething amazing that I've never seen\nbefore. And if you were to take a video\nof it, regardless of the context you put\nit in, anyone would be shocked. A\nproduct like this doesn't have like\nanything like crazy like uh some like\nrevolutionary AI feature or something.\nUm just a product that basically does uh\nhelps create a longevity plan for you.\nSo for these products, what you have to\ndo is basically manufacture it\nmanufacture the features in a way where\nthey are basically engineered for\nvirality. And this is done through a few\nfew different ways. So for example for\nthis product one of the ways that we\nwanted to advertise and we plan on\nadvertising already advertising it is\nbasically sort of going to the um on one\nside on like the self-improvement route\nwhere um we saw a lot of content\nproduced around the fact that you don't\nhave a lot of time left in the year\nwhere people basically have you know I\ndon't know calendars where they check\noff every day as a reminder that they're\nrunning out of time to keep that to keep\nthem motivated and we phrase this\nproduct in a in this way as well by\ncreating widgets They basically tell you\nhow many years you have left or how much\ntime you have left until you die. And we\nphrase it as a like a reminder to like\nto work harder to make you better use of\nyour time. And we know that these will\ngo viral because we've seen content that\ngoes viral like that. And that's why you\nshould produce features around that. And\nthese features still make sense in the\ncontext of the product. And someone who\nis uh and any first of all anyone could\nbenefit from this product. And this is\nsort of the hook to bring users in.\nAlso, you want to make sure that you can\nproduce content out of your product. If\nthey first of all, if you UI is\nterrible, no one's actually going to use\nor interact with the content that you\nthat you that you create. So, you want\nto make sure it's really intuitive and\nreally easy to understand. If I were to,\nfor example, turn this into a meme. I\ntake a screenshot of this of someone who\nhas a 100 more years to live because\nthey have all the perfect habits. Uh\nthey do everything right, do nutrition\nright, they do exercise right, and\nthey're basically set to live until\nthey're 200 years old. and I put some um\ninteresting text over it that it causes\nyou I don't know like laugh or something\nthat that's particularly funny that\nwould work because this is structured in\na very very direct and direct way. For\nexample, this container right here. The\nreason we structure it this way is\nbecause first of all it's very legible\nvery easy to understand but also you can\nturn this into whatever you want in\nterms of content like uh if someone this\ncould easily be turned into humorous\ncontent like most likely ways to dies.\nI'm sure you guys can think of a\nthousand ways that are like silly ways\nto die. And the content itself doesn't\nhave to be a hard sell. It just matters\nthat it involves your app. And as long\nas your target, the audience that is\nseeing the content is somewhat in the\nniche that of who you're trying to\nattract, that that's that is all that\nmatters because some of those people\nthat see it are going to be curious and\nare going to eventually convert to\nactually being uh you know your products\nusers. And this is one route to go. So\ncreating basically uh content off of\nyour um your UI mainly and this can be\ndone in a very simple way. This is what\nwe do for pillar for example. I'll show\nyou our Instagram account and we've had\nmultiple pieces of content go viral\nparticularly on um paper promotions that\nwe've done and this is the structure we\nhave right so for example 8,000 views\nright uh two we get consistently 2,000\n3,000 4,000 views on our videos and this\nis involving the apps UI and eventually\nsomeone in the comment asks about well\nthey ask about Android a lot but someone\nin the comments also asks about what app\nis this where can I get my own custom\nratings right so you have to all you\nneed to do is structure it in a way\nwhere it's really sharable. I'll show\nyou an example.\nThis Instagram page, for example, we\npaid to do quite a few paid promos, and\nwe had a bunch of them actually do\nreally, really well. These last ones did\nnot perform as well, but you can see 10K\non this one, 24K on this one. This is\nall our content that we sent them and\nhad quite a few hit, you know, the\nmillions of views. If we go back uh a\nfew weeks,\nyou'll see that uh a couple videos went\nlike really, really, really viral.\nSo, for example, here, uh, you know,\nalmost 500,000 views, and this is a very\nsimple UI, and people, most people see\nthis, and it's like, oh, it's funny. I'm\ngoing to like it. I'm going to leave.\nBut some people are going to be asking,\nyou know, what app is this? Uh, I need\nthis. Uh, can,\nyou know, can someone tell me how I can\nget my ratings? And that's what what\nyou're aiming for. You can also like\nmanufacture this yourself. This is what\nI did as well. And then I have someone,\nyou know, answer me and be like, oh,\nthis is the pillar app, right? This\nvideo four million views.\nAll it says is it's just a simple meme,\nbut we make sure to include a plug for\nour app that's very clear at the bottom.\nRight? So, it's all about like\nengineering content that can go viral,\nbut also that is is a very direct cell\nfor your app\nis a it actually doesn't have to be a\ndirect cell, but it can be a indirect\ncell, but a very clear cell for your\napp.\nAnd there are ways to phrase this in a\nmore direct way because a video like\nthis for example did really really well\nand got a lot of engagement but also is\nthe conversion will never be great\nbecause it's not as direct. Some people\nmost people are like kind of confused by\nthis, right? So uh here's an example of\na product that does it really well with\na much more direct cell. The product is\ncalled Side Quest and it is in the same\nin the same niche as well. So you'll see\nhow this is like the same same idea.\nIt's like meme format but it's a much\nmore direct sale and their products\nactually do really well. Their account\nhas 8,000 followers, which is really\ngood for an app account. Look at this\nvideo. 800,000 views. This is not even\nit's not even a question that this is an\napp, right? I see this. I know it's the\napp. And then and this is funny and it's\nrelatable and it's also the cell is\nreally is really clear like this is an\napp that helps males clearly since it's\nlike I need a girlfriend assuming that\nyou know in the majority of the case.\nAnd you can see how people engage in the\ncomments as well like what is this app?\nI need this, please. Right. So, this is\na a direct a type of a more direct cell\nthat actually works really well. And the\nother type of content, which actually\nthis is actually great because this\nproduct does really well with this this\ntype of cell because it's really easy to\nclarify who their audience is. And this\ncontent is funny enough and not a hard\nsell, which makes it really easy to\nmassproduce this and also that it's\ndoing well. However, they also post this\nformat. This, you could argue is more\nthe UGC format even though there's no\nface to it. And these videos definitely\ndo not perform as well. Like look, 21\nlikes compared to 124, 74, right? 22\nlikes compared to 44, 93, 100 on\naverage. And this is because this is not\na format that works for their product.\nSo you have to decide what niche the for\nthis format, this UGC format of showing\nthe product usually works for the wow\nproducts that I explained earlier. So\nproducts where like I see it, it's like,\noh my god, this is so cool. I've never\nseen anything like this before. and\npeople are like um are like shocked by\nit. So, they're going to engage\nregardless. And those formats obviously\nconvert really well because all they're\nshowing is a product and the product\nitself is entertainment. Uh but\nobviously it doesn't work for every\nproduct. Like for example, for these\npeople, it doesn't work for Pillar. It\ndoesn't work because these are not like\nrevolutionary products. These are not\nlike the when these AI tools first came\nout. I'll show you a perfect example.\nSo, Study Fetch is a company that I\nactually worked at in the past.\nAnd they went viral. Look at these\nviews. Like come on. 61 million views,\nyou know, 2.8 million likes, 76 million\nviews, 43. These this is ridiculous,\nright? And these are not like boosted.\nThis is all organic. And these went\nviral. First of all, these were posted a\nlong time ago when AI was still like not\nas advanced, but they were still pretty\nshocking. And these went viral. It was\nso simple, but they were shown the\nproduct and everyone was like, \"Oh my\ngod, I can't I I can't believe this.\nThis is so cool. This is like the next\nbig thing. This is going to change the\nworld of education, right? And this\nworks for products like this, but not uh\nsimpler products that are not really\ndoing anything that's like particularly\nshocking, if that makes sense.\nSo, let's say you don't have a huge\nteam. So, how could you should you go\nabout content production? Well,\nactually, I have personal experience in\nthis and Benji does as well. And one of\nthe products that I worked on was Career\nWiz. And an approach that I took that I\nbasically stole stole from other\nproducts that did really well are is to\nbasically experiment as much as possible\nwith content with different formats. So\nI had you would what you need to do is\ncreate some accounts to experiment with\nand some accounts to uh that only post\ncontent that is proven to do well. This\nis for a few reasons. First of all uh\nit's always about volume compared to uh\nsuper high quality content especially\nwhen it comes to social media game\nbecause millions of videos are posted\nevery day. the odds that your videos go\nviral only increase if you post the same\nthing twice, three times, four times,\nbut also because you want as much data\nas as possible at the start. And again,\nthis is an approach that you should take\nonly if uh you don't have uh like large\namounts of funding to spend on\nmarketing. So, this is purely if you're\ntrying to bootstrap it, which uh is very\nlikely, especially if you're watching\nthis and are a student found or\nsomething like that, right? So, what you\nwould need to do is come up with a bunch\nof different formats. You can see here\nhow I have formats where I talk to the\ncamera, formats where I just show my\nface and text over, format where I show\npast job applications and things like\nthat. You have an account where you just\nspam out formats. You experiment with\nevery idea that comes to your mind. You\nmake a video and you post about it,\nright? And this is all you try. And the\nreason this works is because at some\npoint something's going to pick up. As\nlong if as long as you think it's funny\nand you try to engineer all of these to\ngo viral, something will inevitably pick\nup. And then all you have to do is just\ngo to the then create a second page that\nonly posts validated formats. And the\nformats on these pages are guaranteed to\nuh do better than the average purely\nbecause these are proven formats that\nyou know go viral. So it's that's just\nhow it's going to work. And a lot of uh\nstartups actually do this. And an\nexample is for example uh study fetch as\nwell or turboarn.\nThey create multiple accounts to test\nout formats. Look at all these accounts.\nTubular AI and all these formats just\ntest out content. They either hire\ncollege students to run these accounts\nand test content, make their own videos.\nAnd the most viral pieces of content,\nthey post to their biggest accounts, the\none, for example, you know, 19K\nfollowers, which look at these views,\nlike a million views uh uh 4 million\nviews, 90,000 views. And Tik Tok is not\neven the place where they're most\npopular. I'm sure on Instagram, they are\nuh doing even better.\nAnd basically, they use Tik Tok mainly\nactually to experiment, right? And once\nthey find a format, they know it's going\nto work on Instagram as well because\nit's literally the same audience, right?\nIt's college students. And here they\nstick to the UGC format for UGC content\nthat the college students produce on Tik\nTok that blows up there. So they know\nthat it's going to do well on Instagram\nas well. And obviously this is not\nsomething you get right and this is very\ntimeconuming, right? And uh that's why\nusually you build a marketing team or\nyou have college students on retainer or\nsomething like that to create this\ncontent. But it's definitely an approach\nthat you have to do for most products\nbecause it is a quantity game. Unless\nyou have boatloads of money where you\ncan outsource everything, it really is a\nquantity and a consistency game. Another\nthing that's really important that these\nstudy tools can teach us is to always\ntry to involve your target audience uh\nin the videos themselves. Uh if that\nmakes sense. So for example uh here\nlet's take uh side qu actually yeah\nlet's take side quest\nfor example uh this is very clearly\ntargeted toward males and this narrowing\ndown is made very clear obviously by the\nphrasing of this but also because if you\nlook at the picture it's only pictures\nit's only guys it's only dudes in the\npictures and it's usually anime shows\nthat uh that that pe like males would\nenjoy and not females and if you look at\nfor example the study tools. They don't\nhave 50 60 year olds making uh uh study\ntool videos because the people relate to\nwhat they see. If I see a 60-year-old\nusing an AI tool, the first thing I\nthink of is like this is not for me. I\ndon't need this. I'm 20, you know, I'm\nmore than 20. Hopefully, I'm 30 years\nold, younger than them, right? So, you\nhave to make sure to make it very clear\nwho your audience is in the videos. And\nthis is not particularly hard, but you\nhave to keep that in mind, especially if\nyou're paying for content. You want to\nmake sure that every dollar spent goes\nin the right direction.\nA perfect example of an app that truly\nuses its UI to the max to create the\nbest and most engaging content is the\nLiftoff app. So, it's basically an app\nfor lifters that teaches basically helps\nrank your workouts and just keep track\nof your progress in the gym with a in a\nvisualized way. And um look at these\nviews. Like this is all organic. None of\nit is pushed. 50,000 followers. This app\nhas made over $100,000. keep in mind\nwith 80,000 downloads. So they literally\nmake more than a dollar per user\nconsidering that it's a it's a paid app,\nright? Or like a payw wall app. Um so\nyou see this for example again the title\nnarrows down the the target audience. So\nit's obviously towards for Jim Bros, but\nalso the visuals are so simple, so\ndirect and the cell is not so hard that\nit makes it impossible to like\nunderstand that this this is an app.\nlike I I'm still entertained by this\neven though it says at the end really in\na really tiny way that this is the\nliftoff app. So how do you actually go\nabout creating this type of content? And\nit's really first of all it's really\nreally simple and the best approach is\nfirst of all brainstorming like just\nwrite down 100 200 ideas and use LLM to\nhelp you generate even more. But in\nterms of like the actual editing uh\nthere's a few notes that you should keep\nin mind that actually make this content\nmore viral and more likely to blow up.\nAnd first of all is retention. You want\npeople to stick to your video for as\nlong as possible, which is kind of hard\nif you think about it. For these ones,\ngets an image, I see it right away, and\nafter I'm done reading it, it's funny. I\nclick off. But look at what they do. All\nof them had a fade in effect, which\nmeans if you want to understand what\nthey're reading, you have to stay for\nthose extra seconds, which increases\ntheir retention, which means that it\ngives them more time and it Instagram\nsees users are staying here for that,\nyou know, three extra seconds. They must\nreally like this piece of content. Let\nme push it more. And um yeah, so that's\nsomething you need to keep in And we\nstarted doing this for the pillar app as\nwell. So, and we've seen like a pretty\ngood increase in terms of views as soon\nas we started doing that. But what I\nwant to show you is a page that does\nthis perfectly. This guy is is he's not\nselling an app. He's selling his own\nlike I'm not sure like copyrightiting\ncoursees course or something. But if you\nlook at he has a format of video that\ngoes viral all the time like like like\nall always like every time he posts it,\nit goes viral. And this is why like look\nat the video. I have to wait like five\nor six seconds till I have time to read\neverything. And it's an image. So,\nInstagram sees that people reading this\nimage, look at this image video for like\nalmost 10 seconds. That's really, really\nhigh engagement. And you can see this is\neven like one of the worst performing\nones. 200,000 views. If you go back,\nthere's definitely like quite a few with\nhitting a million, 100K, 70K, that type\nof stuff. 1 million, 1.3 million. And\nthis, it literally works, right? So, you\nhave to find these little tricks to\nmaximize retention as much as possible.\nAnd to actually uh make these videos,\nyou literally just use Cap Cut. Uh it's\na very simple tool. And I could\nliterally make one right now. Like all I\nyou could even make these in Figma\nactually. Like let's say let's actually\nmake one at this exact moment in the in\nFigma.\nLet me upload a screenshot of my app\nright here for example. Right. And then\nall I would have to do is add a let's\nsay I'm gonna add the container where I\ncan put the text in up here on top.\nLet's make the container white.\nAnd then I'm I'm going to put a text\nover it that says uh\nlet's see POV. I started taking\nyou started following Brian Johnson's\nroutine.\nThis is a perfect example, right?\nBecause Brian Johnson is someone who's\nbig into like the longevity world and\nliving long and have living a healthy\nlife and all that. And\nand people that are into the space will\nimmediately understand this. And all all\nI have to do is I take a screenshot\nscreenshot of this maybe put it into Cap\nCut before and then I just add like\nmusic under on Instagram and I have a\nvideo done right there. And I copy and\npaste this 10 times. I have 10 different\nvideos already ready that I can post on\nfive or six different accounts today.\nToday. And that's guaranteed. Even if uh\nthink about it this way, you're\nguaranteed 250 views on Tik Tok every\ntime you post. That means that even if\nyou make 10 posts a day and they all hit\nthe minimum of 250 views, you still got\n2500 views. That's a lot of views. And\nconsidering that most of them will\nactually do a lot better than that. So\nthe the the views and the attention is\nout there. You just have to find the\nways to maximize it as much as possible.\n>> Thank you guys for watching this.
