{"transcript": "before we get started I want to make mention that there are affiliate links in the description below which I am compensated for when you use those links but there's a pretty cool donation aspect to that which we'll get to later in the video but right now I want to talk about the difference between Northwest registered agent and comparing it to busy now when you're comparing these two Services I'm going to do this through the lens of starting an LLC I'm hopefully going to make this decision very easy for you and it's an important decision the reason for that is it's not just about starting your LLC it's about managing the LLC LC too to make sure that it is compliant now if you haven't watched my other content it's really important that you understand this the purpose of the LLC is to limit your liability right it separates your business and personal assets so somebody sues your business they come after your business assets and not your personal car home and bank account now the managing part of the LLC is you need to renew your LLC each year Most states some states it's every other year a couple states don't require it those are the types of things that you have to do in order to maintain the LLC so that it maintains its Appliance so that when you're sued they can't come after your personal assets just want to make mention of that cuz it's really important that you understand that now these services are great because they will send you reminders like hey your annual report is due do you want us to help file it for you when you go directly through the state they don't send you great reminders I know this firsthand um but what I want to do here is just kind of compare what you see on this screen right here this is the Northwest LLC screen kind of selling their services and then we also have busy here which we're going to jump into as well now for the sake of uh Clarity we'll use the same state but the first thing I'll make mention of here is the first time I tried to use Northwest I actually screwed up and that's because people read left to right so I went past this text and I just selected a state and let's say uh we choose Colorado here when you do that on their website what you're looking at right here is just a articles of organization which you can see up here and this is just a generator kind of file right it's a template so it's like put in your business name and then all doing is it's entering the business name you could do the exact same thing on the Colorado State website but this is their $0 fee package right so all it does is fill out this articles of organization for you but it is on you to mail it to the state to include a check to go through the process of dealing with the state directly now if you go back and you click over here to start your LLC this is where you pay $39 to them and then State fees which sounds like a pretty great deal right now if you're familiar though busy does offer a $0 package but it does not have everything listed in here that is listed on Northwest so their basic package starts at $0 plus State fee it's $50 in Colorado it's different you know for every state they charge different fees um you get the free registered agent service for the first year and you'll also see that over here all right when you're a free registered agent so this is a great thing to just point out right now awesome that both of these services do that a lot of services charge you right out of the gates for this if you're not familiar a registered agent that is a third party they must have a physical address in your state it cannot be a PO box and they handle important documentation and communication for your business specifically like if you were to be sued right you will get something called a service of process notice and that means that you have to show up to court and they're going to make sure that you're uh getting those documents that you're showing up to court so it's an important aspect of that now what you need to know is after the first year as of making this video Northwest is $125 for that service and then with bsy that first year after the first year it's $119 so busy is $6 cheaper there and then they're also $39 cheaper on the package but when you go down here this is where it's like all right well you're getting a free domain website email and phone and you're not getting any of that with bsy if you want those things with bsy you really have to kind of start spending more money into their premium packages and that's where it kind of like feels like the decision is a lot easier to go with Northwest but it is not not that simple okay so what I'm going to do right now is show you a couple ugly things here inside of your dashboard with Northwest registered agent after you get set up for an account so why don't we start with one of the ugliest things that I can find which is this is welcome to your account this is what my homepage looks like all right now the reason I mentioned this is the website that they build for you they build it it's everything is in house the phone number it's a VoIP that's voice over internet that is something that they do in house your email your SSL certificate all these things is in-house this is what the backend dashboard for Northwest looks like when you log in and click the home button now if I want to manage your business and I click home here you can see it all right now when you take a look at busy hopefully I'm still logged in here this is what your backend dashboard looks like so if I want to go to my dashboard I'll see all of my llc's right here and then I can view that company and then from here I can go to things such as compliance like let's say I get the alert that my annual report is due I can file that with them through their service right here now again you can see what the difference looks like when you're in here and the other thing I kind of find Troublesome here is I've actually seen it where it's just spins like this for a while but again it's like free domain website email and phone that sounds pretty sweet but when you click here this is actually going through and I have painstakingly talked to support about all these things to get the IDE a of what the pricing is so this one right here kind of sums it up right I said $9 for each of the following phone domain business email SSL certificate website and they said yes the domain name is free for the first year it will renew for about $25 to $35 a year which is pretty much how much domains cost but then every single other aspect is $9 a month now I'm going to hide this here the interesting thing is they don't even include SSL certificate on here now if you're not familiar an SSL certificate and I know we're getting into the weeds but this is important to understand when you have an HTTP and then you see that little less there it's telling you it's a secure website they charge $9 a month for that service because this is auto selected when you're in your account this free business identity right here but all these things are going to be $9 a month so your website is going to be $9 a month your business email address is $9 a month the business phone number is $9 a month and then the SSL certificate is $9 a month now not the fet math but that's $37 a month approximately let's call it $450 a year to go with this business identity platform now it gets worse than that though cuz those aren't like crazy numbers all right you can save money by going through other services but why it gets worse is the domain name right let's say you choose to get rid of this service well you're going to have 45 days to actually be able to transfer that domain over and if you don't do it in those 45 days you're going to lose the domain name the phone number that you have that VoIP number you do not own so let's say you try this out for free for 90 days and then you get rid of the service well perhaps you've already put your phone number on things and now you don't own that phone number the other thing too is the email addresses you pay $9 a month per email address all right now if you're anything like me I have a smaller business I don't need a ton of email addresses but sometimes you just want one where it's just like on your contact page info at and then maybe you have one that's more of your personal email address so my recommendation for business email is to either use Google workspace or you can use Microsoft 365 now if you're looking at this $365 $6 a user per month and then with this $6 per user per month on Google workspace but you're going to be getting a bunch of other things as well like you can get a 100 participants when you're doing a video meeting and then you can also get like storage for Google Drive and all these things so my recommendation for you if you do think you'll need addition email accounts because you have those different emails that you want like support at or info at whatever you can add alternate email addresses and you can see here that I can have 30 alternate email addresses and they can have the same domain so what that does is that saves quite a bit because it's pretty easy to start stacking up email addresses and I wouldn't do this if you have another employee but again if it's just that info at your brand name or quote request or things like that you can save a lot of money as opposed through going through a service like Northwest now not to harp on this too much but website hosted by us owned by you so the way that works is it's just a website that is created for um You by their team and again this is what their team created for the homepage of the dashboard of their service now what I would recommend here is I've tried out a bunch of different website Services Squarespace which you may be familiar with let's take a look at their pricing now again again it's going to cost you $18 a month with Northwest to have an SSL certificate and a website with Squarespace it's $16 a month and that includes the SSL so you're already saving money but then on top of that you're also getting you can send invoices for free you can take appointments using their um appointment tool and that's in that package but this will grow with you like for an extra what is that $7 a month you can go into their business category and then you can check out on domain you can have EC sell content and memberships there's a lot more stuff that you'll be able to do and this is a company that has a sole purpose of creating a beautiful website for you or you can have Northwest do it so I don't want to pile on Northwest too much right now but my issue with them is that it's just too misleading in my opinion so when you're looking at this you think you're just paying an extra $39 for these things these are actually all things that are going to cost you a lot more money but also get you locked into their ecosystem and from looking at the backend dat board I don't think it's going to be a great experience for you do you want your phone managed by this company if they have issues with their VoIP service you have issues with your phone as well for your business so at the beginning of the video I mentioned that there are affiliate links in the description below but the funny part about that is I only have one and that is for busy and the reason for that is I was a part of the affiliate uh program with Northwest but after I published a review that wasn't the most friendly of theirs I got an email Emil that basically said we would request that you take the review down within 7 days and if not we have to pause the affiliate relationship to me that just kind of feels like I'm being strong armed into saying everything positive about that brand and did I lose money by being kicked out of their affiliate program 100% but I didn't name the company Biz buddy so that I could lie to you on a review video all right and if you watch that other review which there'll be a card that'll pop open now and I'll have it at the end of this video you'll see how gets even a little bit more into the weeds of concerning things now with the busy affiliate link I just wanted to make mention that we do a program here where we donate $20 for every LLC that is formed through one of our affiliate links where that $20 goes to is a charity called crisis Services which I'm involved with and what they do is they answer phone calls and texts from people in their moment of Crisis so I just want to say thank you if you do decide to use the affiliate Link in the description below because I am compensated but it also goes to a cool charity as well that I'm very passionate about so depending on how you're feeling after this review I would recommend you to check out one of two other videos if you think you want to go with busy I would definitely check out this busy review I go through the backend dashboard in more detail to show you how that looks and then beneath that is the Northwest registered agent review where I go into more of my experience of why I decided to create a review that is a little bit scathing uh but again thank you for consideration of using any of the links in the description below but I hope with this review that I'm going to save you some heartache in the future so you're not locked into a service and that's the right fit for your needs all right I'll catch you in the next video", "language": "en", "title": "Bizee Vs.
