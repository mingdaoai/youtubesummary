{"transcript": "so my mobile app puff count is currently\ndoing $40,000 per month in recurring\nRevenue I honestly don't think you need\nany experience to build mobile apps\nbecause to be H like I didn't have any\nhow did this guy build a $40,000 per\nmonth mobile app with no coding\nexperience well it's all because of his\nunconventional approach to shipping\nmarketing really is 95% of the success\nof a mobile app Steven creada started\nhis journey as a typical online\nentrepreneur jumping from one business\nmodel to another while not seeing really\nany success with anything but one day he\nstumbled upon mobile apps and\nimmediately recognized the opportunity\nnot a lot of people are doing mobile\napps right now but it's a lot easier\nthan a lot of people think to get into\nit's UNT so I gave Stephen a call and\nasked him about his business and how\nanyone can start building similar\nprofitable mobile apps from scratch\nluckily he shared his entire process how\nto find and validate your idea how to\nbuild an app with no experience and how\nto Market and monetize it all right\nlet's get into it I'm Pat walls and this\nis starter\nstory what's up Stephen it's exciting to\nhave you thanks for joining the show can\nyou tell me a little bit more about\nyourself and the business that you built\nyeah sure I'm Steven kada I build Viral\nmobile apps I've amassed over 12 million\ndownloads on my apps in total I'm\nworking on an app right now called Puff\ncount that is currently doing $40,000 in\nmonthly recurring Revenue so this is the\nlast 30 days of sales for puff count as\nyou can see we did $43,000 in sales if\nwe look at the last 90 we have done just\nover\n$112,000 in sales so before we get into\nhow people can actually start building\nthese apps can you tell us what you\nreally like about this business model\nwith apps there's unlimited scale you\ncan reach anyone on the planet and all\nyou have to do is build it once and you\ncan sell it a million times so it's\nunlike any other business in that way\nbut also it's a lot easier than a lot of\npeople think to get into with no code\ntools and with upw work you can build\nthese apps in less than a month and\nthere's templates online so you can\nstart you don't have to start from\nscratch anymore the biggest\nmisconception people have is that like\nit's hard to get into so like not a lot\nof people are doing mobile apps right\nnow it's untapped but I honestly don't\nthink you need any experience to build\nmobile apps because to be H like I\ndidn't have any I don't design anything\nI don't develop anything I just have the\nidea and I know how to put a team\ntogether like you just need to be driven\nand not not give up on your idea got it\nokay let's talk about how you can\nactually build something like this step\nby step everything starts with an idea\nright can you share your ideation\nprocess I take mental notes of problems\nthat I experience in my day-to-day life\nif you're building an app from the\nposition of solving a problem for\nyourself you become the ideal user and\nthat makes you so much better at\ncreating the product and making it\nuseful for the people you're trying to\nreach if you can solve a problem for\nsomeone and you can kind of take them\nthrough this transformation whether it\nbe weight loss dieting quitting vaping\nif you can improve someone's life they\nare going to love your product and the\nmarketing becomes much easier as well\nright because you can be like hey you\nhave XYZ problem here's the solution so\neverything becomes easy if you're\nsolving a problem for someone Steven is\nthe perfect example of how someone with\nzero experience turned a simple idea\ninto thousands of dollars but that came\nwith knowing the right information and\nhaving the right problem to solve now\nimagine there was a place that gave you\nall this the problems to solve the\nblueprints to solve them and the\nstrategies that turn simple ideas into\nmillion-dollar online businesses well\nthat's what you're going to get at\nstarter story it's a library of over\n4,000 case studies and business idea\nbreakdowns where you can access this all\nbacked by data from real entrepreneurs\nso if you're serious about building a\nprofitable side project head to the\nfirst link in the description and we're\ngoing to give you 52 micro SAS ideas\njust like Stevens so you can get started\non your journey right now okay so\nscratching your own itch is definitely\nthe way to go if you want to find a\npainful problem but what do you do after\nyou get the idea for your app how do you\nactually validate it's an idea worth\nbuilding I did market research I looked\nat sensor Tower looked at other you know\nquit drinking or quit smoking cigarettes\napps and I saw that they were crushing\nit looked at Google Trends saw that\nvaping was on the rise and then probably\nthe most important part was I looked on\nTik Tok I saw that Vape videos were\ngoing super viral on Tik Tok but I think\nwhere a lot of young entrepreneurs\nespecially fall short is they they give\nup on the idea too quickly if you have a\ngood idea and it solves a problem for\npeople like commit to it just like me\nfor puff count the first four to 6\nmonths I didn't make any money it was\nonly after I locked in the marketing\nlike marketing is 90% of being\nsuccessful and validating an idea all\nright we'll definitely touch on the\nmarketing later but for now let's focus\non building the app what do you do after\nthe idea is locked in what I do is I\nbrain dump everything so I get on Google\nDocs and I brain dump all the ideas all\nthe features that I want in the app I\nput all the competitors there and I kind\nof write out you know what I think the\napp should do and then from there I\nliterally take a piece of paper and a\npencil and I start to sketch out the app\nwhen you're looking at these competitors\nand you're seeing who's making money in\nyour niche in the Market On the App\nStore you should be taking note of\neverything their features their\nonboarding their UI that will give you a\ngood guide into what a get app looks\nlike and then you take those sketches\nand you upload them to a site called 99\ndesigns you upload sketches and you say\nhere's the app here's the premise of it\nhere are the features make my app come\nto life and you'll have 50 60 sometimes\n70 plus professional UI designers all\nsubmit their idea of what your app\nshould look like this is how I develop\nthe UI for literally all of my apps okay\nand what about turning that design into\nan actual working app how do you build\nit with no coding experience you go on\nto upwork and you look for a developer\nyou can price it based on like the\ncomplexity of your app for an app like\npuff counts fairly straightforward\ncouple main features you get that done\nfor less than 5 grand right you can get\nthe MVP out there I recommend only\nhiring developers from Eastern Europe\nthey're going to give you the best\nquality code for a cheaper price once\nyou have your developer that you'd like\nto go with you do it on a per project\ncompletion basis so I don't pay anyone\nper hour I pay them when the app is\ncomplete it's on the store there's no\nbugs but 100% you can build an app for\nless than $1,000 you can go to a website\ncalled theme forest and you can download\npretty decent starter template for any\napp out there and again you know just\nlaunching an MVP like keep it simple and\nif your budget is tighter like the\nsimpler your app the better and how do\nwe trust the developer what if they\nsteal the idea for our app it's never\nbeen a problem for me and also your\nideas are worth absolutely nothing and\nmore likely than not the idea that you\nhave for this app already exists so like\nthe idea is out there you just have to\ntrust someone I always take like a\n15-minute interview call with with the\npeople that I like from the applicants\non upwork I get their Vibe I see are\nthey coming to the table with more ideas\nfor my app do they seem excited about it\nhow they present but you have to get\npast that fear of hiring someone online\nthat you don't really know like that's\npart of being a Founder is finding great\ntalent trusting them and iterating as\nyou go okay now let's talk about the\nelephant in the room marketing share\nyour strategy marketing really is 95% of\nthe success of a mobile app and Tik Tok\nis the best way to Market any app the\nonly thing you need to be successful on\nTik Tok is you need to know how to do\nmarket research so that's exactly what I\ndid I went on Tik Tok I typed in vaping\nand I saved all of the most viral videos\nthere and I put them into a spreadsheet\nso I could really understand what the\nhook was what the value was how they\nwere shooting the content for example\nthis one that got 8.3 million views\ndrove tens of thousands of downloads for\npuff count I saw a viral video this guy\nhad like 20 million plus views taking\napart a vape so I was like okay cool I'm\ngoing to use the same concept and I'm\ngoing to show people exactly what are in\na vape and then at the end conveniently\ncall to action baby nothing crazy I\nthink we're lot of people go wrong is\nlike they'll make the entire video about\ntheir product and they'll talk about the\nfeatures and all this other stuff and\nthen it becomes a clear sales video like\nthat sucks no one wants to watch a sales\nvideo on Tik Tok my Tik toks are\nentertainment first call to action at\nthe end a quick two second call to\naction okay so right now Tik Tock\norganic is the bread and butter of\nmarketing mobile apps but are there any\nother marketing channels that have\nworked well for you the beautiful thing\nabout organic Tik Tok is if the video\ndoes well organically it's a great\nindicator that it's a great creative in\ngeneral you put them on paid ads and\nclick the spend my money button that's\nliterally all you have to do because as\nlong as the creative is good the\nalgorithms on Facebook ads or Tik Tok\nads or whatever they will optimize\naround that solid creative and they will\nfind you customers what you can also do\nis you can find influencers on these\nplatforms and you can pay them to make\ncontent for you in my experience it's\ntough to you know work with influencers\nthey always want a ton of cash and they\ndon't really care you know how the\nvideos perform for you but you can find\nthose diamond in the rough creators and\nyou can reach out to them and get pretty\ncheap content and you can use that in\nscale that way uh as well okay cool now\nlet's talk about the next step of the\nprocess of building a mobile app\nmonetization what's the best strategy to\nturn these users or turn these eyeballs\ninto paying customers yeah so there's\nthere's many different ways to monetize\napps and in my first games I monetized\nthrough ads because people were on the\napp all the time they were playing the\ngame a lot so the ads worked well for or\ngrid and whle but for these tool focused\napps like puff count ads don't really\nwork because you're not expecting the\nuser to be on your app for a super long\nperiod of time so the way you monetize\nthat is through inapp purchases you need\nthe user to either buy your app or\ncommit to monthly yearly Weekly\nsubscription the kind of strategy that\neveryone is using now is the app is free\nyou go through the onboarding and then\nyou hit what is called a hard pay wall\nthis is essentially a screen that asks\nyou to pay and if you don't pay you can\naccess the features in the app a hard\npay wall is unskippable when I changed\npuff count to a hard pay wall and I made\nusers commit to a free trial before they\ncould use any features in the app it\nchanged my business overnight my\nconversion rate shot through the roof\nupwards of 20 25% nice and what about\npricing how can someone find the best\nprice point for their app I AB tested\ndifferent pricings I started at $4 went\nup to $12 right with a lot of users\ncoming to your app you're getting a lot\nof data and you're understanding which\nprice point gives you the highest LTV\nthe highest lifetime value I use super\nwall to do this you can remotely\nconfigure your pay walls and you can\nchange the price without sending App\nStore updates so you can do it much\nquicker and super wall will actually\ntell you which price point will give you\nthe best LTV so I just optimize for that\nthe highest LTV price point you\nmentioned earlier that before getting\nhit with the pay wall the user is being\nwalked through the onboarding process\nwhat's your experience with that the\nonboarding is super important because\nthis is an opportunity for you to walk\nthe user through their own problem so\nfor example on puff count my onboarding\nis extensive and I ask the users a lot\nof questions and some people say that's\nannoying I don't want to do that I just\nwant to get into the app but the data\nhas told me that if I walk the users\nthrough the onboarding they commit time\nand I'm able to walk them through their\nproblem that puff count is solving so\nwhen they hit the pay wall they've\nthought about their problem a lot and\nthey're like wow I actually really do\nneed to quit or I really do need this\nproduct and they're much more likely to\nconvert all right now let's get\ntechnical what tools in software do you\nuse to build all of these apps the Tex\nstack I use to build apps is pretty\nshort I use upwork to find and hire\ndevelopers I use 99 designs to get the\nUI built I use super wall to AB test my\npay walls optimizing your pay wall is\nhow you're going to make money with your\napp like you need to optimize your pay\nwall and find the highest LTV so that is\n100% essential everyone who has a mobile\napp should be using super wall I use\nRevenue cat for analytics data Revenue\ncat is good too because that will give\nyou more data on your user lifetime\nvalue and again your user lifetime value\nis like the most important metric in\nyour app you need to understand how much\npaying users are generating you over\ntheir lifetime so that you know how much\nyou can spend on paid ads or on\ninfluencers or on installs and as long\nas your customer acquisition cost is\nlower than your LTV you're you're making\nmoney I use apps flyer as my MMP it\nconnects with my my mobile app and\nFacebook or Tik Tok ads and sends data\nback to those platforms I use Tik Tok\nand Facebook ads to send traffic I also\nuse mix panel amplitude to get kind of\nmore in-depth analytics in my products\nand see what people are doing in the app\nonce they do download it once they do\npay and Gat code is like you should stay\non the free plans I don't think you\nshould ever really upgrade mix panel or\namplitude like you should get your data\nunderstand what you need to change and\nthen get out all right for anyone\nlooking for ideas I want to ask what do\nyou think is the most lucrative Niche to\nbuild an app in right now when I look at\nlike the most profitable niches in\nmobile apps I think a lot of them do\nhave to do with help helping people be\nbetter lose weight quit vaping quit\ndrinking anything in the health space I\nthink will absolutely crush and of\ncourse like there are already apps that\nare doing really well like in Fitness\nyou have like my fitness pal you have\nall these weight training apps but it\ncomes down to the marketing can you get\nin front of people at a cheaper cost\nthan these mobile apps right being a\nyoung founder you truly do have an\nadvantage because all these old heads in\nthe industry these big slow moving\ncompanies that never iterate on their\nidea a small Nimble entrepreneur rur can\ntake them out all it takes is one viral\nTik Tok all right another question for\nyou some people watching this right now\nmay have started a couple other things\nbefore but didn't see immediate results\nand eventually gave up or quit what\nadvice would you give to those people\nthe struggle of building something new\nis it's never going to be perfect on the\nfirst try but I've done this enough\ntimes now to know it's a process and you\nhave to keep iterating I know it's a\ngood idea I know it can make money\nthat's all I need I don't need it to\nwork super quick right like I just need\nthat Val validation um and then I can go\nout into the market and talk to talk to\ncustomers and make it better over time\neverything is built over time puff\nCount's been live for 4 years but only\nthe last 6 or seven months have I really\nmade decent Revenue per month it takes\ntime it takes commitment and you have to\nbe willing to learn all right next\nquestion how does a day in the life look\nlike for a mobile app builder like you\nI'm actually nomading I've been\ntraveling for about 6 months now I'm in\nEurope time so my day doesn't start till\nlater in the afternoon like 1:00 p.m. is\nwhen I start hopping on the phone and\ntalking to people so I have my morning\nto myself make a coffee go to the gym\nget a workout in and then I'm in the\nzone to start you know building start\ntalking to my team start taking sales\ncalls whatever it is and I work till 700\n8 900 p.m. sometimes much later\ndepending on what's getting done and\nthen you know on the weekends I have a\nchance to explore an entirely new city\nand new culture and meet new people and\ntry new things so inspiration is a\nfleeting feeling and when you do feel\ninspired to build an app or build a new\nproject or work super hard like you have\nto take advantage of it going back to\nwhy I kind of like decided to be a nomad\nand travel like it's so I can do more of\nthat so when I had these moments of\ninspiration I wasn't distracted by\nanything I can lock in all right last\nquestion that we always ask if you could\nstand on young Steven's shoulders and\ngive him some advice or advice for\nanyone who wants to make it in this\nonline business world what advice would\nyou give first of all it's not as hard\nas you think like you just have to be\ndriven and you have to you know be\nwilling to to work with people who have\nskill sets that you don't Outsource what\nyou're bad at and build a team around\nyou build a team that you trust treat\nyour team well and again don't give up\nsuper early on the idea it takes months\nsometimes years for a project to take\noff relentlessly talk to users get\nfeedback and iterate Based on data a\nhuge mistake that I see first time\nmobile app Founders doing is like\nthey're like hey I have this random idea\nfor a feature in my app that I think I'm\ngoing to spend two months developing\nright before launching my MVP don't do\nthat like go to market with something\nsimple that you can afford get feedback\nfrom users and then build on top of it\nwith your team all right stepen thank\nyou so much for your time the businesses\nthat you've built are amazing and thank\nyou for coming on here and sharing it\nwith everyone peace Brother yo guys I\nreally hope you enjoyed the rest of the\nvideo and got some good takeaways from\nStephen but I want to say something\nquick at the end of the day the point of\nthese videos is to inspire you and show\nyou that this is possible so that you\ncan go start your own thing on your own\nwhile learning is important and will\ngive you new ideas action is the thing\nthat's actually going to move the needle\nforward and take you where you want to\ngo so research learn find an idea and\nthen go build that as fast as you\ncan if you're still feeling a little\nloss right now click that first link in\nthe description and you're going to get\na free list of micro SAS business ideas\nso you can get going on your side\nproject much love and I'll see you guys\nin the next one peace\n[Music]",
