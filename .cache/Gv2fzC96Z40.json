{"transcript": "all right David what's your\nstory I was working from my parents\nhouse in the bedroom day and night I had\nno money and it was time to really it\nwas time to Make It or Break It this is\nDavid Park and for years he tried\neverything to make money I started my\nfirst company when I was 16 I'm 27 now\nthat's a decade of failing then one day\nhe came across an idea that would change\nhis life forever but at the beginning\nthings weren't looking so bright a cold\ncalled every single Agency for 8 hours a\nday for weeks and weeks and weeks they\nhang up on you reject you literally\nprobably 99% of the time but when\neverything was at its worst David\nexperienced a miracle suddenly we get a\nhuge wave of users when we're getting to\n50 60 880,000\nMr then I got a cancer diagnosis and it\nfelt like my dreams and nightmares were\nhappening at the same time this is the\nstory of how David Park built an AI app\nto a $25 million valuation in Just 2\nyears I'm Pat walls and this is starter\nstory David grew up in a family of\nentrepreneurs and even though they never\nhad a lot of money he still had a dream\nthat he could be one too when I was in\nseventh grade I thought you know man\nit'd be so cool if like if I'm a founder\nand it'd be so cool if I can build stuff\nand so when I was 16 I actually made my\nfirst company was like a clothing brand\nobviously it failed spectacularly David\nexperienced his first failure early on\nand like all protective parents they\nsacrificed everything they had to send\nhim off to a college in hopes for a\nbetter life my parents gave me $20,000\nand they said you know you go to college\nyou're going to have a better life than\nus you're going to go be a lawyer doctor\nthe sad thing is I kind of felt like I\ndidn't really fit in anywhere I didn't\nreally feel it fit in in my fraternity I\ndidn't really feel it fit in with like\nthe people in my major I was always\nsurrounded by people but I was like a\nlittle bit lonely which is kind of sad\nDavid was facing a dilemma he was an\nentrepreneur at heart but he was trapped\nin an environment that didn't make him\nhappy so we made a huge decision he\ndecided to drop out and Chase his dreams\nof starting a startup and luckily along\nthe way he meets someone just as weird\nand passionate as him his eventual\nbusiness partner and co-founder Henry he\nloved AI I loved writing we always try\nto find some way to make it work the sum\ntotal of failed startups that we did\ntogether was probably n or 10 which is\npretty nuts eventually we stumbled upon\ngpt2 we asked it to tell us a story gpt2\nspit out this line that said nothing is\ndarker than a butthole and and obviously\nas two people enamored with this Tech we\nwere raving we're like this is the\nfunniest line ever also it's profound\nthat butthole sentence convinced us two\nbut holes to create Jenny all right so\nthis is a quick product uh video for\nJenny the boys had found their idea and\nand now the business was in motion Henry\nwould do the coding and David would do\nthe selling their goal was simple create\na product to help agencies write better\ncontent with the help of AI and their\nnext goal was to make their first dollar\nthat was like a terrible painful time of\nuh cold calls obviously nobody wants to\ntalk with you they hang up on you reject\nyou you have to get used to getting\nrejected so I was working from my\nparents house just in the bedroom it was\npretty sad my mom she would wake up and\nthen she'd hear me just like raving to\nsome poor soul about why they need to\ninvest in us or they need to buy us and\nthen she'd go before she'd go to sleep\nshe'd still hear me kind of speaking to\nsome other poor fellow so I like pretty\nmuch just working uh day and night the\nworst part was like Korean moms will\njust get together and just talk about\ntheir kids like their trading cards like\nmy kid is now a level two Amazon\nengineer my kid is now doing their\nmasters at Stanford and then it would\nget to my mom's turn and she would just\nsay oh my son is working on a startup\nthe most humilating thing was I had to\nask my mom for her card if I wanted to\nget Chipotle cuz I just had like no\nmoney I was a real loser but my parents\nwere so kind to me like they never made\nme feel like a loser like they would\nalways um they would always give me food\nand they never make me feel bad about\num uh\nthey never they\nnever\n[Music]\nuh so they never make me feel bad about\nanything they just always like there was\nalways just food on the table on days\nthat I didn't believe in myself I felt\nlike my parents believed in me my\nco-founder would believe in me my\nfriends obviously believed in me so it\nwas painful but I guess I'm glad that I\nwent through them\nyeah in 2020 GPT 3 came out David is\ngetting some traction thanks to a wave\nof businesses wanting to get their hands\non AI they're getting users but\neventually they hit a plateau they try\neverything but they can't get past\n$2,000 a month in Revenue then David\nlearns and implements something that\nwould change his business forever it\nreally came down to the boring stuff of\njust talk to your users ask the more\ndifficult questions of you know you\nshouldn't be asking why do you like my\nproduct you should be asking why do you\ndislike my product like what like what\ndo you love about other people's\nproducts the focal point of I feel like\nmany Founders they talk to users is like\nthey make it about themselves and their\nproduct when it should really be about\nthe users tell me about your current\nworkflow how does Jenny fit into it what\nexactly do you do with Jenny or like can\nyou share your screen and can we write\nan article together these insights are\nreally important we realized that people\nwanted to have a friendly AI assisted\nwriting journey and so when we pulled\nout everything that was when we really\nstarted to grow after months of talking\nto customers and refining the product\nthey start to find a new audience for\nJenny but at this point David basically\nhas 0 left in his bank account he's\nexhausted all of his options but he\ndecides to try one more thing he agrees\nto go on a random podcast to talk about\nhis startup Journey it doesn't have that\nmany listeners but luckily one Scout for\nJason calanus happened to listen to the\npodcast the craziest Miracle ever cuz\nlike it was not viewed by many people\nand so I got a $100,000 check from Jason\nlike I said I was living off Shin Ramen\nand you know what whatever my parents\nput out on the dinner table so $100,000\nwas so\ncrazy the first thing we do is my\nco-founder and I we book a flight to\nMalaysia because at the very least it'll\ncut down our Burn by 1/4th we basically\njust want to extend our Runway because\nwe kind of didn't trust ourselves with\nthe money it was a crazy moment getting\nthe check but I didn't feel successful\nat all because now the real job of\ngetting my hands dirty was actually\ngetting started I kind of raved earlier\nabout like how much I love my family but\nbut um I was alone by myself it was very\nproductive but it was very lonely it was\ntough it was it was character building I\nwould say I had 100K check I was\ncompletely by myself it was time to Make\nIt or Break It Now the real dirty work\nhad begun with a bit of funding and a\ntiny Runway David and his co-founder\nspent the next several months iterating\nand building Jenny into a completely new\nproduct talking to customers documenting\nthe progress and trying just about\nanything to increase Revenue then one\nnight something incredible happens\nsuddenly we get a huge wave of users\nevery minute I refreshed the page I\nthink we would get tens of us new users\nevery minute that I refresh the page a\nguy named Zay Khan posted a Twitter\nthread that became one of the most viral\nTwitter threads in history and we were\nactually included in that thread from\nthere we went from like 2,000 to 10,000\nMr in one month that's when I felt the\nfirst semblance of success Jenny AI was\ngrowing at a rapid pace and Dave felt\nlike he was on top of the world but\nthere was still a problem virality comes\nand goes it's not something David could\nrely on to build a great business so the\nvery next thing I wanted to do was kind\nof figure that out for ourselves I\nbrought on one of my college buddies\nactually to help us with Tik Tok and\nInstagram reals All That Jazz and then\nwe experienced our second wave of\nvirality we understood the power of\nsocial media we continued to kind of\npush on with uh viral marketing when we\nwere getting to 50 60 880,000 Mr you\nknow now it was kind of happening where\nI think at at that point we were close\nto like a million a year from where we\nstarted that was like so crazy to us and\nI felt like man we could push this so\nmuch further we could go so much farther\nbut then I got a cancer diagnosis and it\nfelt like my dreams and nightmares were\nhappening at the same time the the most\nworrying thing for me though is that it\nwould put me out of commission and there\nwas a chance that my voice would be\ndamaged I remember the surgery because\nof the fever they had to reschedule me\nwhich made my sleep deprivation food\ndeprivation all that even worse it\nprolonged my pain more but one thing\nthat helped was my mom told me that\nthere's something I I'll tell you before\nyour surgery and don't worry it's going\nto give you all the strength you need\nyou're not even going to be nervous\neverything's going to be fine and then\nso for some reason my mom went to the\nbathroom or something while I was Tak a\nnap and like the nurses run in and\nthey're like because of your fever\ncomplication we have to do surgery right\nnow I don't even speak Korean to be\nsigning documents like can we wait for\nmy mom and then they're like we just got\nto run it now and I was honestly\nthinking about like man I got a crazy\nstartup right now I can just bolt out of\nhere thyroid cancer moves kind of slow\nlike it's it's not like the craziest\nrisk I could take but I remember on the\nceiling there was a Bible verse it said\nlike leave everything to God I was like\nall right well I'll leave it up to the\nbig man upstairs like i' I I have to get\nthe surgery so I'll just stay I don't\nknow what I just signed my mom's not\nhere it's fine I'll just stay the\nsurgery went well I was able to not\nspeak for a little bit but I was able to\nget my voice back few days after the\nsurgery I was like hey Mom like what was\nthat thing you want to tell me for the\nsurgery she told me oh it's just it's\ndumb it was just this one Bible verse\nthat I really liked and it happened to\nbe the same Bible verse that was on the\nceiling which is pretty crazy to me\nwhere I take it as is like Miracle what\nan awesome little blessing that I got I\nhad to read that somebody had to tell me\nthat and my mom was in the bathroom so I\ndidn't get she didn't get to read it to\nme but thankfully that painter put it up\nthere for me so I got to read it after\nthe surgery I was obviously very\nemotional I was very moved by the love\nthat I receiv received from like my\nfamily and my girlfriend and I thought\nthe limited time I have left with like\nmy family my grandparents all that stuff\nbut instead I'm I'm spending so much\ntime on my startup like so much time\nso I actually shopped Jenny to like if\npeople would be open to acquiring Jenny\nat that point David was facing a wave of\nproblems after his surgery he realized\nthat the business was unstable without\nhim leading the pack after seeing no\ngrowth when he was out with cancer David\nalso realized Jenny did not have product\nMarket fit so he had a tough choice to\nmake either Cash Out grab a quick few\nmillion bucks and start fresh or double\ndown find ways to fix the business find\nproduct Market fit and take things to a\nwhole another level it just didn't feel\nright to like throw my cards in early\nyou know it wasn't like a triumphant I\nwill not sell this will it's sort of\nlike I don't know if this is the right\ndecision but it just feels right in my\ngut that one hard decision I made I'm\nvery proud of myself from then I focused\non hiring people on the marketing growth\nside and we went into more scaling mode\nI would say up to the 1 million we're\ndoing a lot of exploring trying out a\nbunch of zy ideas a bunch of paths and\nthen from 1 to three we really started\nheavily deploying capital in the ones\nthat were successful tactically what I\nwould do is I would basically start a\nTik Tok account try a bunch of different\ncreative formats and then find one\nformat that works and somehow turn that\ninto a series and then start multiplying\nyour accounts so you could have multiple\ncreators you're basically paying\ncreators like some baseline monthly\nsalary and you're giving them some\nincentives where like if your videos get\nX many views or if you get y conversions\nthen you get you know even more money\nper month you should basically just\nthink about how can you scale the\ncontent I think that's like the big\nquestion you should\nask I started my first company when I\nwas 16 I'm 27 now that's a decade of\nfailing I really only got any semblance\nsucess in the last 18 months so it's 9\nyears almost a decade of just gut\npunches people not taking you seriously\nyou need that discipline I think if you\nreally care about your dream and if you\nreally care about making something that\nis used by millions of people people\nthen you can't give it like a onewe shot\nyou can't you can't even give it a year\nshot you have to really put your all\ninto it sacrifice everything for many\nmany years and then you have a shot you\nhave maybe a chance at success but even\nif you put your all into it there's a\nchance that you will fail if you still\nmake a startup and if you still try\ndespite knowing that you could have\nnothing and you could lose everything\nthen that must mean that you really care\nabout what you're building and you\nreally care about making better life for\nyourself your family your users we\ntalked about quitting earlier had I sold\nthen which was earlier this year it was\nonly like 6 7 months ago you know it\nwould have been such a terrible decision\nfor me to sell at that point because\nwent from selling to 3 million now we're\nat 3 million AR we're above 3 million\nthe true worth of our startup now is\nprobably like 10 to 30 million you know\nit's like it's like way more than what I\nwould have sold for then within 6 months\nwe more than doubled our business yeah\npersistence is quite important I would\nsay hey Pat from starter story here\nthank you guys so much for watching I\nreally hope David's story inspires and\nmotivates some of you to get started on\nyour own thing
