{"transcript": "So, you want to start a boring business\nthat prints cash, but you don't have the\nright idea. So, you go on YouTube or you\ngo on X and you see start an HVAC\nbusiness, start a plumbing business. But\nthe reality is a lot of those businesses\nare really competitive and difficult to\nget into. So, I brought on the boring\nmarketer and he shared he revealed his\nsauce for how to find startup ideas in\nboring spaces that print money. And he\ndoes so by using these NAN workflows\nthat scrapes Google Maps data and then\nhe actually uses AI to power the whole\nbusiness. Now, I was hoping he was going\nto share this and I had to convince him,\nbut he finally did. And this entire\nepisode is about how to actually find\nthese ideas, how to actually build these\nbusinesses, and actually how to quietly\nprint money with boring businesses using\nAI. Thank you to the boring marketer for\nspilling the sauce and thank you to\nHostinger for sponsoring this episode.\nEnjoy the episode. Like, comment so we\ncan get started.\n[Music]\n>> We got the boring marketer on the pod.\nJames, by the end of this episode, what\nare people gonna take out of it?\n>> I want to help people find the perfect\nniche to go and start a boring local\nbusiness. I think that this is a very\noverlooked opportunity. Everyone's\ntrying to create a sexy SAS and I want\nthem to kind of look in their backyard\nfor opportunities that can get them\ngoing.\n>> And are you going to use AI to help them\nfigure that that out?\n>> Of course. Always do. We're going to\nwe're going to look at some workflows,\nsome cool AI use cases, and uh we're\ngoing to talk a little bit about how\nI've used this information for my own\nboring local business that's doing\npretty well right now.\n>> Yeah. So, basically, there's this unfair\nadvantage using AI to figure out which\nboring business to actually create. And\nJames, by the end of this episode, are\npeople going to have like the\nconfidence, the prompts, the workflows\nto do this?\n>> Yep. They're going to have clear ideas\nwhat they should go attack. They're\ngoing to have some frameworks for how to\nthink about what niche they should go\nafter and I'm going to walk them through\nworkflows that, you know, they can copy\nand use on their own if they want.\n>> Great. Let's get into it.\n>> Let's do it. All right. So, uh, you\nknow, last time I was on, Greg, uh, I\nwas telling you about, uh, Diesel Dudes,\nwhich is,\n>> uh, the local boring business that I\nstarted with one of my friends, uh, here\nin the Carolinas. And uh since I was on\nuh that business has grown to do like a\nconsistent like $30,000 a month uh in a\nvery short amount of time. Like\nhonestly, I've been pretty much blown\naway by like how quickly it's it's taken\nhold. And I've been doing some\nreflecting on like why it worked out\nwell. And I'm going to try to translate\nsome of the key like patterns that I've\nseen so far uh in its success. So,\nthere's a few things that people should\nbe thinking about if they want to enter\ninto the boring local business space.\nAnd uh the first thing is that you want\nto find underserved opportunities. So,\nyou know, you look on X or whatever and\nthere's a bunch of like MBAs and stuff\nlike that and everyone's like, I'm going\nto go and start rolling up plumbing\ncompanies or HVAC companies or\naccounting firms and everyone's thinking\nabout the same like three to five niches\nuh when they want to, you know, get into\nthis uh type of space. So, what I think\npeople should really be looking at is uh\nthey should be going deeper and kind of\nignoring the ones that everyone else is\ndoing. Um, what do I mean by that? Um,\nif you think about like home services\nfor example, um, there's all these like\nlittle micro niches that have very high\nuh, order value or customer value. So,\nI'll just ramble off a few and some\npeople might know what these are, some\npeople might not, but hardcaping. So,\nthese are people that come and build\nlike retaining walls at a house. Um,\nsmart home automations or irrigation\nsystems at a home. Uh these are like\nthree to $5,000 uh services um on one\njob that someone comes out and\naccomplishes in basically a day. Um\nother ones that I really like uh closet\nredesign and organization sounds super\nniche, but there's a lot of wealthy\npeople that want nice closets, believe\nit or not. The other one, garage\norganization and renovation. So my\ngarage is an absolute disaster. I had a\nguy come out and give me a quote on like\nrefinishing my garage and making it look\nnice and it was like a $15,000 quote. I\nwas blown away. Um, I need to sell a lot\nmore like local business services in\norder to go and do that. Uh, but I was I\nwas pretty surprised as how few people\nwere serving that market and how\nvaluable a potential customer was. So,\nhigh customer value, underserved\nmarkets. So, the next question someone\nmight ask is, \"That sounds great, but\nhow in the world do I actually find\nsomething like that?\" And that's where\nAI is going to come into play.\n>> All right, you caught my attention.\n>> All right, cool. So, the first the first\nthing that someone needs to do is\nbasically take what I said, take that\ntranscript right there. I want to find\nunderserved local business ideas that\ndon't include plumbing and HVAC and all\nthe common ones you see people talking\nabout on X. I need a high customer value\nand I need this to be like an\nunderserved market. So there's not a ton\nof providers. Um, you know, you can say\nlist out 20 different potential niches\nuh in various locations. Locations that\nI like to target are referred to as like\ntier 2 cities or tier three cities. So\ndon't think about like Los Angeles or\nNew York or, you know, Chicago or San\nDiego or something like that. I live in\nCharlotte. There's a ton of opportunity\nhere. Think about like Nashville or\nAtlanta or, you know, uh Dallas, Texas\nor Denver, Colorado. They're growing\nquick. They have uh you know, wealthy\npeople that are like moving there in\ndroves. And that tells me that there's\nprobably a lot of demand uh for services\nand not enough providers uh that can\nactually go and do the work. So, you get\na list of hypotheses, right? That's\nwhere I started. And then the next thing\nthat you're going to do is you're going\nto run those hypotheses through a\nworkflow like this that I'm about to\nshow you. This is a local uh niche\nresearch workflow. And uh I'm going to\nwalk you through kind of the main points\nhere. And you know, this is like a\npretty complicated workflow as you can\nsee. Um it took a long time to actually\nbuild it out, but it has a lot of value.\nAnd um in terms of this workflow, uh\nit's going to be available in the\nmarketers community. I'm just going to\ngive it away for free there so that\npeople can come up with all kinds of\nideas. So if you want it, uh go to uh\nthe vibearketer.com,\nsign up. You'll find this inside as like\na community benefit. But uh what it's\ngoing to do is it's going to look at one\nof my favorite treasure troves for\nmarket intelligence and opportunity\nidentification, and that's Google Maps.\nSo, if you're looking for a service\nlocally, one of the first things that\nyou look at is Google. You're not going\nto chat GPT to find like local\nbusinesses that you want to go and hire.\nYou're probably going to go to Google.\nYou're going to look at reviews. You're\ngoing to see, you know, businesses that\nare close to you and all that. So, we\ncreated a scraper that goes out and\ntakes these hypotheses for ideas and\nlocations and runs them through this\nworkflow in order to validate it,\ncollect a bunch of data, and then let AI\nkind of synthesize it and tell you if\nit's a good idea or not. Make sense so\nfar?\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n>> All right, cool. So, um, basically, like\nI said, you're going to specify the\nniche and location that you want. It\nmust be like a city and state, and then\nyou can have like multiple keywords. So,\nwe're going to go out and scrape Google\nMaps. So, we're going to look at the\ntitles of different businesses, their\ndomain, their address, their contact\ninfo, and we're going to collect the\nreviews. So, we're not just going to\nlike look at the actual reviews. We want\nto understand review volume and velocity\nfor one. So, why volume and velocity? To\nme, that's a good uh signal that there's\na lot of demand in the market. You know,\nwe don't want to go into a market where\nthere's like five Google reviews out\nthere. We want enough volume coming\nthrough that we know that there's plenty\nof customer demand. And then what we're\ngoing to do is actually look at those\nreviews and gather the sentiment around\nthat service. So imagine, you know, you\ncan go and find a niche that has, you\nknow, hundreds of reviews every month,\nbut customers are generally not happy.\nTo me, that sounds like opportunity or\narbitrage, right? Next thing we're going\nto look at social presence. We're going\nto get Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn\ndetails of all of these businesses.\nWe're going to capture what times these\nbusinesses are open. You know, for\ninstance, maybe there's a gap uh in\nterms of, you know, certain businesses\ndon't have nighttime hours or something\nlike that. And this could be like an\nemergency service that that people need.\nUm, so after we gather all of that data\nwith this workflow, we're going to\ncreate some calculations. I kind of\nmentioned these a little bit, but how\nfast are new reviews coming in? How many\nplayers exist in that niche locally? um\nare customers satisfied? Is consistent\nservice being offered? We're going to\nlook at like the top uh 10 and the\nbottom 10 players and uh and really kind\nof identify who the market leaders are.\nSo um next step like I said AI market\nanalysis. So, we're going to get the\ndata. Then, we're going to look at uh\nthe patterns across the niches, missing\nhigh potential ideas within the niche,\nuh certain angles that a business could\nplay on, um what the opportunities are,\netc. So, I'll just give you like a quick\nlook at uh at what that looks like, and\nthen I want to touch on how uh you can\nset up uh workflows like this really,\nreally quickly and uh and save a lot of\nmoney doing so. All right. So, here's um\nhere's an example of the output. So, I\nran it through uh like Charlotte, for\nexample, and I've got landscaping. I've\ngot cosmetic dentistry. I've got wedding\nuh design services, destination wedding\nplanning, luxury tax advisory services,\nestate planning attorney for high netw\nworth individuals, smart home automation\ninstallation, luxury home security\nsystems, exotic car detailing services,\nuh custom car wraps, body contouring med\nspa, dermal fillers, sports\nchiropractor, custom pool builder, and\noutdoor kitchen designer. So, we've got\na lot of really interesting, unique\nmarkets that aren't the ones that, you\nknow, everyone's typically trying to go\nafter.\n>> Yeah. I mean, someone I will say\nsomeone's going to be looking at this\nand they're going to be like, \"All\nright, but I don't know the first thing\nabout car wrapping.\"\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, what do you say to someone like\nthat? Well, uh, what I say to someone\nlike that, you know, the the big\nopportunity here, you don't necessarily\nhave to go and be an expert in any one\nof these markets to create a successful\nbusiness here. So, let's say you know\nnothing about car rapping, but cars kind\nof interest you or something like that.\nOne way you could play this is you could\nstart a local newsletter uh that\nattracts the end customer. So maybe for\ninstance you start a local newsletter on\ncar meetups in the area or something\nlike that. You know there's all kinds of\nthem. I see like coffee and cars or you\nknow antique car uh meetups or\nenthusiast groups. Enthusiast groups are\nalso a great market to to think about.\nSo think about creating like a\nnewsletter or a directory that's sort of\nbroad within the niche. So that's one\nway that you can leverage AI quickly.\nYou could vibe code up a directory site.\nYou could vibe code a newsletter landing\npage and then you could use some of the\nclaude code SEO tactics that I talked\nabout in our last video to get traffic\nto that site to get subscribers. Right\nafter you get subscribers, that puts you\nin a totally different position to\nattack a market. You're not going and to\nthe to the exotic car uh you know,\nservice companies or whatever and\nsaying, \"Hey, like I'm starting an\nagency. I really want to help you grow\nyour business.\" you know, they get\nhundreds of those types of uh messages a\nmonth. You're saying, \"Hey, I have one\nof the top newsletters in the local\nmarket with a bunch of car enthusiasts\nand I want to figure out how I can pass\nsome on to you and I think it would\nreally benefit your business. Is there a\nway that we could partner up or\nsomething like that?\" So, I I think\nthat's the way to frame it and to think\nabout it. Um, you know, you don't have\nto be an expert. If you know how to use\nsome of these AI tools, you can attack\nthese markets and really help out\nanother one of these types of\nbusinesses.\n>> Yeah. I think the way to think about it\nis you're not going to be in the car\nrapping business. You're actually going\nto be in the media business, like the\ncar media business. And people think\nthat the media business is actually a\nbad business to be in. Because when they\nthink of the media business, they think\nof like, you know, Time Warner or Kai\nNast, you know, these big media\nconglomerates that have spent billions\nof dollars incubating and building these\nmedia assets. The difference today is,\nuh, you know, it just doesn't cost that\nmuch to create the media, you know, with\nall these AI tools. So if you can\nactually go and you know attract a highv\nvalue customer uh you know and and then\nultimately pass them off from a lead\ngenen perspective to someone else get a\ncut of that your margin is going to be\nsuper high your costs are going to be\npretty low and your competition is going\nto be low and that's why I'm that's why\nI'm interested you still have my\nattention. Like think about it. If if\nyou're going and trying to create like a\nnational media company for like you know\nvehicles and cars or something like\nthat, there's going to be a lot of\ncompetition. Good luck.\n>> Yeah. Good luck. Have fun. Like go on\nInstagram. There's pages with like\nmillions of followers. There's\nestablished websites getting, you know,\nmillions of visitors a month. But if you\nnarrow that down into a local niche and\nyou create, you know, the best kind of\nlike vehicle media company in uh, you\nknow, Nashville, Tennessee or something\nlike that, your competition is going to\nbe, you know, much smaller. And those\nmedia companies, if they even do exist,\nthey're not an expert in leveraging AI\nto automate a lot of facets of this\nbusiness, create highquality content\nquickly, and move fast. So, I think that\nthat's really kind of one of the\nopportunities for people in terms of\nthis arbitrage uh that's out there.\n>> And and in terms of like how big could\nthis be? Like Nashville car wrapping\nlike you know, are we talking $50,000 a\nyear of profit, $200,000 a year of\nprofit? Like what are you thinking?\n>> I mean, I can speak to like uh to the\nmobile diesel mechanic uh business in\nCharlotte and Colombia, right? If you\nthink about that, uh, you know, top of\nyour mind is probably it probably\ndoesn't sound like that big of an\nopportunity. Uh, however, um, average\ncustomer size currently is $1,600 per\njob. Um, we get probably 10 inbound\nphone calls every single day. We can't\neven service all of the calls that we're\ngetting right now. We're trying to hire\nup to keep up with the demand. So um you\nknow I think that this alone could be\nlike a multiple sevenf figureure\nbusiness in two uh locations. So once we\nfigure out those two locations and we\nhave the playbook and we can scale that\nout or whatever um you know it can be\nreally really significant. Um again uh\nI'm going the route where I'm actually\nbuilding out this infrastructure and the\noperations and hiring the people but you\ndon't have to do that. If I were doing\nit the way that we're talking about with\nmore of a lead genen play or a lead\ngenen model, uh there's really kind of\ntwo ways that you can approach that. Uh\none is, you know, you create that\nnewsletter uh type thing and uh you you\nacquire the end customers and you go to\nthe business and you say, \"Hey, like um\nI'm going to uh sell you leads for $100,\n$200 a piece or something like that.\"\nYou know, if a company's got like a\n$1,600 average customer value, they\nwould happily pay that. That's probably\nwhat they pay on Google Ads or something\nto get a a hot qualified call coming\ninto their business. And this is just\nanother channel that could add some\nincremental opportunities for them. So,\nyou know, imagine if you uh are able to\nget, I don't know, 200 300 uh phone\ncalls or hot leads a month for a\nbusiness in in one of these markets that\nclearly have enough demand. I mean, your\ncosts are pretty low. It could be a 20\n$30,000 a month company right there.\n>> All right, let's continue.\n>> All right, cool. Um, all right. So, uh,\nsomething that I want to highlight when\nsetting up a workflow like this, let's\nsay you're an entrepreneur or something\njust kind of getting, you know, a\nbusiness like this going, you want to\nkeep costs low, you want to move\nquickly. Uh, one of the tools that you\nshould think about, uh, which I use for\nthis workflow is Hostinger. So uh\nHostinger uh allows you to create\nvirtual private servers for your inadin\nworkflows. So you know typically uh\npeople would go to NADN and they would\nsign up for a hosting account here. Uh\nand they would be you know limited in\nterms of the amount of workflows they\ncan run per month and they'd be spending\nyou know anywhere from 20 to 50 to 100\nor $200 a month to to run these\nworkflows and host them uh online. So\n>> wait so James Yeah. When when when you\nsay that like I see the concurrent\nexecution. So basically NAD limits the\namount of\nworkflow executions you can do at a\ngiven time. Is that what you're saying?\n>> Yeah. You get a certain amount of\nworkflow runs per month per plan. So on\nthe $20 plan you get like $2 and a half\nthousand. $50 plan you get 10,000. Uh\nyou know bigger point is that uh you\nknow it's $50 a month. We already\nsubscribe to a lot of SAS tools. I have\nso many and I'm like always trying to\ncut my costs. So I use Hostinger for\nthis and I was able to you know get this\nhosted on the cloud uh for you know\nbetween like five and and $7. So and I\ncan create unlimited workflows on there\nand uh and scale this up. So in terms of\nlike cost and scalability I think this\nis something people should look at uh\nwhen they're when they're working with\nlike tools like inadin.\n>> Cool.\n>> Yep. So easy process. Choose your plan.\nUh, you know, once you log into\nHostinger, uh, there's a virtual private\nserver item over on the menu. You're\njust going to add a new virtual private\nserver. Uh, select your location where\nyou want your server to be. Just type in\ninade.\nSelect it. Hit next. You'll create a\npassword uh to log in with. Um, I didn't\nselect these additional features. You\ncan if you want. And uh you know once\nyou're in you'll just create some inadin\ncredentials and uh you'll be able to log\ndirectly into uh to your workflows there\nand uh it's self-hosted on your own\nprivate server for for a lot cheaper\nthan what you might typically uh pay. If\nyou want to self-host your workflows\nsuper easy. You just go to\nhostinger.com/sip10s\nsip10 to support the channel.\n>> Cool. Yeah. Cheaper and and more\nworkflows.\nfor less. So yeah, so yeah, like\nbasically, you know, we're getting the\ndata here and uh I'll run through it a\nlittle bit uh more before we go to the\nnext stage. So I just wanted to talk\nabout a couple of these like unique\nangles within these markets. So uh for\nlandscaping, you don't need to go and\nstart like a landscaping business. You\ncould be the eco-friendly or sustainable\nlandscaping service that you know\nspecializes in water features and koi\npond installation or something like\nthat, right? So, um, you know, there's a\nlot of money in these micro niches in\nlocal markets. That's the main point\nthat I want people to kind of take away.\nAnd Google Maps is like a great data\nsource uh to go and look at, hey, is\nthere a high number of reviews? Uh, are\nthere not that many providers in the\nmarket? And kind of look at those,\npattern match a little bit. And, uh,\nit's a great way to, uh, you know, get\nover that, uh, you know, mental tail\nspin of like, I don't know what niche to\ntarget or or whatnot. So let AI help you\nthere and uh and work with some data for\nit.\nUm so let's just take an example like\nlet's say you decided to uh pick the\ncosmetic dentistry market or something\nlike that and uh perhaps you have like a\nsub angle or a subniche within it. Maybe\nyou focus on like you know uh family\nservice and and you work well with kids\nor something like that. I don't know.\nSo, uh, I fed in all of the the review\nsentiment and the pain points that are\ncoming from this Google Maps information\ninto another, uh, workflow, which is a\nnewsletter creation workflow. So, this\nworkflow here, it's going to feed in\nthis data. We have an AI agent that's\ngoing to look at all of it. It's going\nto come up with a bunch of ideas in\nterms of like uh your topic, your angle,\nsubject lines, uh and some business\nrationale to uh to decide if this is\nlike a good newsletter issue or a good\nnewsletter angle. So, uh this creates\namazing newsletters uh after it's able\nto collect all that Google Maps data.\nIt's got a wealth of of context that\nit's feeding into the agent and uh you\nknow, I was really pleased with kind of\nlike how it came out. Um, so yeah, hits\non all the pain points someone might be\nthinking about. Uh, again, you could\nintegrate things like local events or\nuh, you know, links or, you know, things\nof interest that the market might be\ninto and then you're addressing all the\npain points and you've got a bunch of\ncontent uh, that you can send out uh, to\nget those leads.\n>> It almost sounds too easy, dude. You\nknow what I mean?\n>> I know. I know.\n>> Yeah. cuz like kind of what you're\nsaying is like all right so I'm going to\nI'm going to use Google Maps which by\nthe way I've never even thought of using\nGoogle Maps as the data source but makes\ncomplete sense so I'm going to use\nGoogle Maps data source to find reviews\nand I'm going to find niches with sort\nof bad reviews with high velocity so I'm\ngoing to find really good niches\nvalidated and then you're you're going\nto use AI to actually essentially build\nthe media um completely reusing the\nwords that people are using in Google\nreviews\nand just set it out on autopilot and\njust execute on this.\n>> Exactly. Exactly. I mean, you could use\nany any of the newsletter tools out\nthere to build like a fast landing page\nor whatever. Um you know, build out some\nlocation or uh service pages or whatever\nthat looks like. I mean, again, you\ncould go to Chad GPT and say, \"Hey, like\nhere's the niche that I chose. Uh, it's\ngoing to be cosmetic dentistry. Uh, what\nother like SEO pages or whatever could I\nput on here to get people to come and\nsign up for my newsletter?\" And, uh, you\nknow, you don't need to go crazy and go\ninto all the SEO keyword research tools\nand all that. I didn't do any of that\nfor Diesel Dudes. And we get all of our\ntraffic and and leads from the search\nresearch I did on on GPT5. So, uh,\nthat's really all you need to do. And I\nthink this is a massive arbitrage. Like,\nand and nobody's really talking about\nit, which blows my mind.\n>> You say nobody's really talking about\nit. Nobody is talking about it.\nLiterally, on my timeline, it's\nliterally, it's all the same things.\nHVAC, plumbing,\nuh, you know, pool cleaning, it's all\nthe same thing. And what's going to\nhappen is you're going to have a bunch\nof people who are just going to who have\nno business, you know, building in that\nspace, go into an extremely competitive\nspace with, by the way, a bunch of\nsharks. There's like a bunch of like\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Wall Street funded, you know,\ncompetition. And I know some of these\npeople um and you're they're going to\nget their, you know, lunch eaten.\n>> Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, like if you\nknow enough about AI to be dangerous,\nyou can build workflows, you can use,\nyou know, the tools that are out there,\nthings like that. Um, this presents a\ngreat opportunity for you to create like\na lowcost business by doing the\nresearch, right? Like find those\nunderserved markets in in these tier 2\nand tier three cities. find your angle,\ncreate the media asset, and then you can\nresell the leads, you can get verified\npartners, whatever. You could do that to\nfund actually creating your own uh\noperation if that's what you want to do\nafter you learn enough uh over time.\n>> All right, man. Well, I appreciate you\nsharing the sauce. Um you could have\nkept this one to yourself, but you're\ntoo good of a person. I I app that's why\nI love you.\nI'm sure I'm going to get uh get some\ncompetitors that are going to be uh\ntrying to get into this and stuff, but\nbut that's okay. There's plenty of room\nfor everybody to eat in this like local\nniche uh boring business space if they\ncan use AI\n>> mobile diesel gals.\n>> That's right. That's right. Plenty of\nbusiness. Maybe I can uh send them some\nof our lead overflow that we have.\n>> Um I appreciate you. If people want to\nlearn more about workflows, learn more\nabout Vibe Marketing, learn more about,\nyou know, using AI for boring\nbusinesses, where could they go?\n>> They should go to the vibearketer.com.\nUh, sign up for the newsletter. We send\nout workflows like the one we talked\nabout every week. Uh, we highlight all\nthe cool things that are happening at\nthe intersection of AI and marketing.\nAnd then we have a community where we've\ngot like over 2500 workflows and a\ndirectory we built for our members. Um,\nI've got a new secret project that I\nlaunched exclusively within our\ncommunity. You know all about it, uh,\nGreg. We've been working on this for a\nwhile. I think it's going to take Vibe\nMarketing as a whole to the next level.\nWe're giving away a bunch of free\ncredits there. I'm doing Vibe sessions\nin the community every other week where\nI'm just getting on for like two hours\nat a time, jamming with members. We're\nbuilding out a mentor program. A lot of\ncool things happening there.\n>> Amazing. Uh, I'll include the link. uh\nto that in uh to the VI marketer uh and\nthe and the community in the in the show\nnotes. Uh I'll include the link to\nHostinger uh in the show notes. I think\nuh we reached out to them and got a a\ndiscount code, right?\n>> Yep. Exactly. Yep. We got a discount\ncode. Throw it in the show notes and uh\npeople can save a lot of money on their\nworkflows.\n>> I think it's SIP 10. Uh, and thanks\nagain for hosting her, for making this\nepisode possible and and getting James\nto, you know, extract some sauce and and\nand I appreciate you. And, uh, I'll see\nyou next time. Also, let us know what\nyou want us to cover next. You know,\nwe're always looking for topics for\nwhat, you know, what we should cover\nnext. So, you know, I read every single\ncomment. James goes in there and reaches\ncomments, too. So, let us know and uh,\nwe'll sauce it up.\n>> Awesome. Thanks for having me, Greg.\nAppreciate it.", "language": "en", "title": "My AI agents scrape Google Maps to make $$ in BORING businesses"}
