Steph Smith, I've been trying to get you to come 
on the podcast for eternity. Eternity. And it's  
finally happened. You're the queen of trends, 
the queen of ideas. You can't set me up that.  
And I heard you're bringing the sauce today, so 
I'm excited about it. We'll see. We'll see. So  
what do we got? So I'm giving away $5,000 so you 
can build your startup idea. Now, $5,000, you can  
actually do a lot with nowadays. You probably can 
build a startup with $500. So the way to win the  
$5,000 that I'm giving away to one of you is 
you got to drop a to this YouTube video. Takes a  
second. Comment. What startup idea would you build 
with $5,000? Let the comment section know. The  
third thing is subscribe to the YouTube channel. 
You've probably subscribed already, but you aren't  
subscribed. And the last thing is you're going to 
want to head to the pinned comment of this video.  
There's a link to gregeisenberg.com, and you're 
going to subscribe to Greg's letter. This is the  
email which I send occasionally with startup ideas 
and frameworks for you. And the next email that I  
send, just reply to it and say, I want to win the 
giveaway. And I'm going to pick one lucky person,  
a random person, who replies to that email. And 
I'm excited for one of you to win $5,000 to see  
what you built. And shout out to the folks at 
Beehive because they're the ones that put up the  
$5,000. They want to see you build your 
ideas. And I think that's really cool.  
So show them some love. You probably already 
know them. They're the email platform loved by  
creators. Excited to see who wins. and enjoy this 
episode. Your prompt to me was, you know, we're in  
this crazy new AI world, and so I have two groups 
of ideas. One of them is, you know, kind of using  
AI to build different ideas, but then the second 
half is, , we're in this world where things are  
changing quickly. what still stays the same or 
what is actually kind of tech agnostic that I  
think becomes even more important, kind of along 
the thread where people are , oh, chess, you know,  
computers beat humans a long time ago, but somehow 
people are still watching humans, something along  
that thread of just what actually doesn't really 
get disrupted in this new world. And by the end of  
this episode, what do you think people are going 
to get out of this? Hopefully a way of thinking  
about, again, this kind of barbelled world and 
then just a bunch of new ideas in both categories.  
For free. For free. Oh my God. All right, let's 
get into it. All right. So a few of these are  
kind of just things my requests for startups. 
So one of them is, you know, an open pages,  
right? Lots of startups have them, right? They 
basically are these pages where people who choose  
to share their stats openly often, revenue users, 
things that, decide to put that in the open. And  
there's these cool open pages with charts and 
things that. Not that many people have been able  
to build those pages in the past, and they've been 
kind of selective in that they only cover revenue.  
But a few years ago, I created an open page that 
was more about my life, right? So it's , what  
books am I reading? I'm trying to exercise X 
percent of days. How am I doing with that? And  
I think we're now in this world where, as you 
know, just about anyone can create something,  
whip up a page in Cursor or Bolt or some of these 
new companies. But I also think there's an opening  
for someone to create the open page creator for 
just about anything. What supplements is someone  
taking? Again, how are they exercising? What is 
their glucose monitor saying? And obviously they  
can select what they want to show. But I feel 
that is something that in the past people just,  
it would have been too difficult to create and 
too difficult to create the slew of different  
kind of categories or things to display on the 
page. , but what do you think? I, I think it's,  
it's, it's kind of two things. One, I think it's, 
you know, the technology allows you to actually  
create these pages. So that's huge. But also I 
think people want the social, social motivation to  
actually, you know, , do things, right so Strava 
yes I'm not a runner but every runner I meet talks  
it's hey what's your name I'm on Strava you know 
it's it's they they love talking about it so I  
just feel for me that's validation that there's an 
opportunity to people care about leaderboards and  
social motivation yeah and the open page I created 
years ago still to date is one of the things, even  
though I never promote it, that I get contacted 
about the most. And often it's , how do I create  
my own? Or , basically, , I want to set up the 
same thing, but as you're saying for running or  
some other part of my life. Let me show you an 
example of this is I'm biased because my husband  
created this, but he learned to use cursor, and he 
never coded before. And he created this stats page  
for his surfing. And so it's basically, again, the 
same idea that you might for a startup and their  
revenue. But instead, it's thanks to his tracker 
for how often he's surfing, where he's surfing,  
who he's surfing with, his GitHub tracker for his 
surfing and how often he's getting a session in,  
how he's tracking against his goal. How did he 
create this? He used Cursor. Literally. Yes. And  
so that's the thing. I think a lot of people think 
that Cursor is the one shot. You get a static  
landing page and that's all. But if you actually 
learn to use the tool, we're at a point where he,  
by the way, was the kind of person who I tried to 
get to learn to code so many times and never did  
it. And now, you know, this is a pretty there's 
dynamic animations on the page. When you come  
in here waving, you can email him. Again, there's 
this tracker of how often he's doing something. If  
you go to the breaks page, you can see the breaks 
he's surfing at. You can learn about them. So this  
is a kind of one, a solid representation of what 
he's doing. But I also think the interesting thing  
about open pages is it's almost a reflection of 
your personality. And I know that sounds woo woo,  
but it's you are kind of creating a combination of 
art and data that reflects your life. And for him,  
that's surfing. But for someone else, it might be 
running, as you said, or , what would you create  
an open page for? Right now, probably tennis. 
There you go. Yeah, right now, tennis. Yeah. And  
there's no tool today that would represent tennis 
probably in the way you want, both visually,  
but also the metrics that you want to track or 
the things that you care about, who you're facing,  
how you're doing, how you're improving. , and 
so today more than for sure three years ago,  
you can do that and you can do this by the way 
in a matter of days or weeks. I think another  
big trend obviously is sobriety Yeah So I think 
having that how many days you been sober you know  
how many you know the last time you had a drink 
I think that could be huge also Exactly So there  
both the software for one if someone wants to go 
create this on their own behalf where they yes I  
on this sobriety journey and I want to be able to 
display this in my own unique unique way to people  
but then there's also who can go and create 
this software for someone who's not willing  
to learn cursor and spend a few weeks in there to 
basically create something that's modular and that  
is customizable for people and their unique tennis 
or drinking goals. Also people if you don't have a  
personal website yeah just make a personal website 
yeah I feel do you have a personal website I do  
I imagine you didn't I just try I just trashed 
everyone who didn't no no I have one and by the  
way that was one of the first things I created 
when I started you know being a quote creator in  
2017 or 2018. And that got me connected to so many 
people as well, because instead of creating it  
on some, you know, website creator Squarespace, I 
also taught myself to code and made it custom to,  
again, the way I wanted to show up. And I had 
so many people David Perel in his very first  
writing cohort for Rite of Passage. He featured 
that because he was , look at this creator who is  
not creating the kind of standard landing page. 
And again, I think it's a way to tell people how  
you want to show up by actually creating something 
that's , again, a visual representation of you. If  
you were building this startup, you know, how much 
would you charge for it? How much do you think  
people are willing to pay for something this? I 
mean, I think you could create the equivalent of  
the existing, you know, landing page creators 
where you get a free page that's very simple.  
And then you just upcharge based on, again, 
the modules that you want to add. So imagine a  
fitness influencer who specifically wants to show 
Andrew Huberman, he has certain advertisers and  
he wants to show who he's affiliated with or the 
types of supplements he's taking on Thorne. Well,  
you could upcharge for that and you could upcharge 
for, you know, runners who want to right now,  
the Strava embed is horrible. I love Strava, but 
if you want to actually show how often you're  
running or again, your progress towards certain 
PRs, you can't show any of that. And so you  
could have upcharges based on your affinity for 
customization. One thing I to do is to look at ads  
that come up because that shows me if it's a good 
business or not. And website builders advertise  
everywhere. Every podcast. Every podcast. VPNs. 
Well, because it's also recurring revenue. There's  
a bunch of other startups as well, but that people 
kind of throw shade on because they're , oh, it's  
just a link page, right? There's so many startups 
that are just building link pages. And that's  
because there's limited real estate on , you know, 
you have you've built up an Instagram profile and  
you only have one link. But imagine if instead 
of that link page just directing to your personal  
website or your podcast, you actually, again, had 
something modular that represented the things that  
you care about. And then to your point, there's 
all kinds of things you can add there, too. If you  
want to monetize as well, you can monetize on that 
page. So imagine you had a supplement section,  
and you truly included the supplements that you're 
taking and that you care about, but then you also  
had AG1 in there, and it's clearly represented as 
an ad. But that gives you real estate now to play  
with that's a lot more creative than just your 
standard, hey, it's Steph, or hey, it's Greg page.  
By the way, OpenPages, I don't know if that 
domain's available, but that's the perfect  
name. We're going to find out. Namecheap. You're 
a Namecheap girl? I am. What are you? On my worst  
days, I'm a GoDaddy guy. On my best days, I'm an 
Amcheap guy. One day you'll be a Cloudflare guy.  
So openpages.com is not... I got confused because 
there's openpages.it.com, which we obviously don't  
want. It was registered in 1996. But openpages.me 
is available. OpenPages.me is pretty legit. And  
.xyz.inc. Yeah, .gg. Go grab it. Okay, I had 
an idea related to this. Yeah. And I want  
your opinion on it. Okay. So go to my website, 
GregEisenberg.com. When you scroll down, you see  
this popular guide section? Yes. So you, I create 
a lot of content and people bookmark my stuff. So  
I started basically taking some of my most popular 
tweets, basically, and putting them into guides.  
And so I made these landing pages and thousands 
of people every month download them. And it got  
me thinking that every personal webpage, just 
every personal webpage should have an open page,  
should have essentially a knowledge open page that 
you gate so you can get people's email address.  
Interesting. Why that's important is because 
we're all on social and the algorithms change  
sometimes and we want to own the email address so 
we can connect with our community, our audience.  
And I don't know, and maybe you know, but I don't 
know of any specific platform that helps me manage  
this lead magnet for personal web pages. I don't 
know if that's dedicated to personal web pages,  
but yeah, you can create a lead magnet site that 
pushes people through the funnel through things  
HubSpot. But give me an example of, so you've got 
this one that's , find winning startup ideas. So  
how would you change this page? Or you're just 
saying you think a product should exist that helps  
you create these. Yeah, if I go to Squarespace, 
for example, and I make a personal website,  
which is where millions of people are doing that, 
it's strictly informational. informational. It's  
strictly about me, who I am, maybe some pictures, 
social media links, but it's nothing around taking  
the next step. Of course, you can have a link 
that says, subscribe to my newsletter, but that  
just doesn't work anymore. I guess that's the 
insight. Saying, hey, subscribe to my newsletter,  
people have hit fatigue in terms of newsletter 
fatigue, but they are willing to put in their  
email address if they're going to get something 
out of it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think your point  
just about what worked in 2010 for marketing on 
the web is just out the door. And so that's why I  
think people should absolutely, there was always 
this gap between people knew that, you know,  
static landing pages from the past were outdated, 
but I don't know how to actually create something  
new. And we're now at a point where actually you 
can create just about anything through a tool  
cursor, right? Where you can actually code and 
dictate your creative vision on a digital page  
and it not being hard at all. And you can actually 
differentiate in that way. And so I think that's  
maybe the prompt that people should take is just 
, sure, you can whip up something very quickly on  
insert marketing tool here, but then you're just 
going to look everyone else. And that's just not  
good enough today. So I think maybe that's the 
takeaway. All right. What else you got? Okay so  
this one is we were talking a lot about health 
so this is a personal request And I sure people  
are working on this In fact I feel I know people 
working on bits of this but just there needs to be  
some centralized platform that integrates all of 
the information that you are capturing regarding  
your health. So , I'm wearing a CGM right now. I'm 
one of those people who have, , I've got an eight  
slate people of Aura range. CGM is a glucose? 
Continuous glucose monitor. Yeah. Yeah. But  
also it's if you use Strava, that data should 
be in there. If you go and use function health  
and get your blood done, that should be integrated 
into the same platform. If you go see your doctor,  
I'm taking medication right now. So it's that 
should be in there as well. An example of why  
this matters is so I ran my first marathon on 
Sunday, did not go as well as I was hoping,  
despite a year of training. but I've been facing 
this nausea thing which feels very different from  
a fueling issue or an energy or training issue and 
it's been so hard to figure out and only after the  
marathon it dawned on me that oh my gosh this 
medication that I've been taking for the last  
few months only might be playing a role in what's 
going on here because again it's this weird nausea  
thing that I've asked so many runners and they're 
I've experienced other stuff but nausea not so  
much and if I had this tool that was integrating 
all of the information, it could triangulate and  
at least give me suggestions or at least, you 
know, imagine a chat GPT interface where I could  
probe it and be , is there anything happening in 
my whole health ecosystem that you might think  
could be causing this? And that just does not 
exist. In theory, a doctor should do this, right?  
In theory, a doctor should have the wholesale 
understanding of what is happening in your body,  
but it doesn't. Right. In theory, the doctor 
should be the data warehouse. and there should be  
an AI layer that you can ask it based on the data. 
Yeah, and so this is again my request for startup  
because all of these tools, whether it's Dexcom or 
Abbott, they have CGM APIs that you can integrate  
into. Strava has an API. So all of these things 
exist and the data can be imported in, but there  
needs to be some sort of good application that 
aggregates it and makes sense of it. And then to  
your point, has kind of your digital doctor layer 
where it's not prescribing anything, but where you  
can interrogate it and I can say, hey, this was 
my HR or my heart rate during my marathon, and  
this is the point where I hit an issue and I felt 
nausea, , what's going on? And obviously it can  
integrate information from the web as well, 
which would actually be much more effective  
than a doctor because the doctor can't actually 
be probing the web in real time and pulling in  
all that information. So that's my request for 
someone to build, which is an integrated layer of  
everything. And obviously you can pick and choose 
what you want to bring in. But to date, I haven't  
seen this. And I think that's actually been a 
limitation of many of these products, too, where  
people wear an Oura ring and they're , it's good 
because I can see the data, but I don't know how  
to relate this to my life and actually take action 
on it. Yeah. And it's it feels this is a business,  
I mean, that people would pay for. I would pay for 
it. How much would you pay for something this? i  
mean i think i would pay substantially more than 
the classic ten dollar per month subscription  
just because it is i mean if you think about 
an eight sleep costs thousands of dollars an  
aura ring costs hundreds of dollars many of these 
other things strava you're paying ten dollars a  
month for so i think there's an awareness that 
those things that people are spending money on  
are not quite giving them the information that 
they need to make it actionable and so maybe  
I'm more ready to pay than the average person, 
but I would for sure pay at least $30 per month,  
especially in instances where I'm trying to solve 
an issue the example I just gave. And it could be  
one of those businesses that you actually sell 
to, I don't know how this works, maybe you know,  
but as a perk to businesses, right? So the 
companies would pay for their employees at no  
cost to employees to basically use this product. 
Totally. I don't know why I haven't seen this more  
in the U.S., but when I was in the U.K., friends 
of mine would be on health insurance plans that  
would incentivize them to do healthy things. , 
this already existed. My friend's , do you want  
a free coffee at Starbucks? And I'm , why do you 
have a free coffee at Starbucks? And he's , well,  
my insurance plan has given me points or, you 
know, free dollars to certain things because  
I have, you know, if he's wearing an Oura ring, I 
have achieved a good health score or sleep score.  
or because I've gone to the gym a certain number 
of times or I've seen my doctor on a regular  
basis. I don't remember what the inputs were, but 
he specifically was , my health insurance plan has  
done the data analysis to determine this is worth 
X to us for someone to be a healthier person. And  
therefore we're going to incentivize this through 
rewards. Incredible. I mean, health is wealth.  
Maybe that's what you call this thing. Maybe 
you call it healthiswealth.ai. Yeah. And I mean,  
there's tiny little things. People are going 
to find them silly. But I swear there is demand  
for this where you could also just be this ongoing 
health assistant for folks where there are so many  
things that, for example, I don't drink enough 
water. I just am never thirsty, never have been.  
But I know I should drink more water. I tweeted 
about this two days ago and there was 400 comments  
of people being , either I have the same thing 
or I fixed it with these really simple tricks.  
But I think at the end of the day, if I read 
all of the comments in that thread, the answer  
was just building a habit. I'm , I can't build 
a habit on my own. I need an assistant to remind  
me as silly as it sounds to be , it's time to 
drink water. And I know there are apps for this,  
but if it's a lot more customized, personalized 
to your way of operating, instead of me having to  
open an app and remember, I think there's little 
things that. posture is another thing where if you  
have this ai assistant and it knows your issues 
i feel there's just ample opportunity to be that  
micro fix in order to build the habit and to you 
know help someone i guess address the issues that  
are unique to them i love it by the way just so 
you know this you think this is water barking  
water but i actually put put a little Celsius in 
here. So it's sort of a melange. So I'm also one  
of those people who don't drink enough water. It's 
so funny. Celsius water doesn't count. It's funny  
because there's for sure, I don't know what the 
percentages are. There's people who hear that we  
don't drink much water and they're just , what's 
wrong with you? You're a mammal and you need water  
and this makes no sense. But then I don't know. 
There's, I don't know if you're this, but I just  
have never drank much water. I think it's kind 
of the late debate where people who are late just  
will never understand people who are not late and 
vice versa. I think it's a lot of us heard that  
you need to drink two liters a day and we're just 
, it's outlandish. So then I just lose all trust  
in the system. It's , it's the, , breakfast is the 
most important meal of the day. And then it's the  
egg companies that sponsor that, that message. And 
it's , okay, obviously I'm not eating breakfast  
anymore Yeah The water thing though I feel I 
trust that we need water I just don understand  
the mechanic of why some bodies don seem to have 
as clear a signal that they thirsty I guess we've  
just gotten used to being constantly dehydrated. 
Could you give us one last idea before we leave?  
Yeah. What kind of idea do you want? You want 
something more still in the AI world? Okay, well,  
here's just a – let me give you two quick ones. 
One of them is just when you think of the Internet  
five, ten years ago, there was this huge wave of 
once information became digitized, that there was  
this opportunity to create directories. So you 
have things Nomad List, which was just , let  
me take all the data that exists and aggregate it 
to make sense of what cities nomads should go to.  
There's tons of other examples where literally 
directory companies became really sizable.  
but today my prompt for people again this is a 
really quick idea is just what directory companies  
or websites can become custom gpts so nomad list 
is great but what's better is the ability to have  
your custom gpt where you say hey i care about 
these things or i want to you know i really over  
index on wanting good weather or i actually 
have no money and so i really need this place  
to be less than a thousand dollars per month and 
to be able to chat with it, which places don't,  
or do I need a visa for, et cetera. And so I 
just think using the frame of what exists as  
a directory that can be improved through a custom 
GPT, nomad visas is one, one frame. And then. Are  
you seeing people make money through custom GPTs? 
Not yet. have you seen any i heard one story of a  
lawyer who owns all the top legal gpt and and he 
buys all the custom if something comes up he'll  
just go and reach out to the developer and be i'll 
buy it and he's using it as a legion so basically  
people are and millions and millions and millions 
of people are, , you know, prompting for, I need a  
contract for this or I need that. And then he's 
just basically reaching out and being , Hey,  
do you want a real lawyer? , so I've only heard of 
from a lead gen perspective, which by the way is  
interesting. That's super interesting actually. 
Yeah. So to that point, I think I'm trying to,  
so in order for custom GPT to, I think be able 
to monetize, you do need some sort of specialized  
data that other people don't have. Because if that 
same thing can be done through ChatGPT or Claude,  
you don't have a business. But to your point, if 
there is a custom GPT that is uniquely effective  
at answering someone's specific set of needs, you 
might be able to monetize that. But just creators  
have different ways of monetizing through ads, 
affiliates, or their own products, I think your  
point about it being a lead gen mechanism is 
equally interesting and I think would work for  
many of these topics. So my last thing is I feel 
with AI, there's got to be better dating apps.  
Neither of us are single, but I think if you look 
at the prior wave... Yeah, let's get the married  
people to come up with ideas for dating apps. 
We're that annoying person where we're , I think I  
can solve your problem. But okay, my seed for this 
one is just simply that dating apps today, and  
maybe this is just a reflection of the way that 
humans think are all based on looks. So you're  
swiping and you're , in theory, you're adding all 
this other information about, you know, I to do  
this, or this is my favorite thing to do with my 
friends. But it's all swiping based on do I the  
way this person looks. But if you think about the 
mechanisms for people to actually come together,  
it's things humor, it's things intelligence, 
and none of the AI or none of the apps today,  
I think accurately capture those things. And 
obviously different people index on, again, humor,  
intelligence, all of those things in terms of what 
they care about. But I met someone in Bali years  
ago who was creating an app. I guess it didn't 
work. So worth noting. But he was basically , what  
if the app was instead of scrolling on someone's 
face, it was scrolling on memes? So you're just or  
swiping rather. So you're swiping on things and 
it's basically getting a sense of your sense of  
humor, right? And basically, according to that, 
it then is going to match you with different  
folks. And obviously, then you can still be , am 
I attracted to this person? Do I want to chat with  
this person? You still have agency to choose. 
But I just think, especially with AI today,  
this is easier than ever for you to base to be 
able to create, whether swiping or otherwise, a  
mechanism for determining if people are compatible 
based on those other traits. I'll take your idea  
further. So I think from what I hear from people 
in single land, they are tired of swiping. So why  
don't we just remove the swipe? You download 
the app, you figure out, you know, the memes,  
the memes that you . Do you it? Maybe there's an 
initial, you know, onboarding where you do swipe  
for , I this meme, I don't that meme. and then it 
just assigns you to a person to meet basically a  
blind date 7 p.m. You know you're going to meet 
over here. They know where both of you live.  
Yeah. And good luck. And it gives you some sort 
of prompt. I mean these AIs are so good at being  
you guys right both this movie or you both enjoy 
running or whatever it is and it can even get  
more specific than that. But imagine taking the 
idea further. It's you don't even have to swipe.  
You can choose what applications you want to 
integrate. So maybe it connects to your Goodreads  
or maybe it connects to your Netflix or your 
Strava or insert thing here that has information  
about the way that you live and the things that 
you . Your open page. There you go. I mean,  
in a future world when everyone has an open page, 
that would be the perfect mechanic to identify if  
people may be at least initially compatible. 
I do think that the future of dating is with  
no swiping. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, basically your 
personalized AI matchmaker. Basically arranged  
marriages. By the AI. You still get to choose if 
you want to stay in the relationship. But yeah,  
I that. And I the idea of it just setting up. 
I think I heard of a company that's doing well  
doing this. I can't remember the name, but it's 
just it sets up a time for you. It says meet at  
this time and it picks a location as well. So 
you don't have to think about any of the dating
