{"transcript": "[Music]\nThis is Macrovoices, the free weekly\nfinancial podcast targeting professional\nfinance, high- netw worth individuals,\nfamily offices, and other sophisticated\ninvestors. Macrovoices is all about the\nbrightest minds in the world of finance\nand macroeconomics telling it like it\nis. Bullish or bearish, no holds barred.\nNow, here are your hosts, Eric Townsend\nand Patrick Szna. Macrovoic's episode\n501 was produced on October 9th, 2025.\nI'm Eric Townsend. Lyn Alden took first\nplace in our top five macro guest\ncountdown, concluded with last week's\nepisode number 500. But guess who\nactually beat Lynn for the single\nepisode download count title? That's\nright, it's freelancer.com founder and\nCEO Matt Barry, whose interviews on\nartificial intelligence have all been\nlistener favorites. Matt and I will\ndiscuss all things AI in this week's\nfeature interview. Is it a bubble about\nto burst or a new secular trend that's\njust getting started and will soon be\nbigger than the internet itself? And\nwhat happens when the masses start to\nrevolt after hyperscalers consume all\nthe new electric generation capacity\nthat we can possibly bring online? in\nthe next decade or two. That's all\ncoming up in this week's feature\ninterview. Folks, I've been traveling\ninternationally all week and I have to\nconfess I'm not quite as in tune with\nmarkets as usual. So, I'm going to defer\nto Patrick for most of this week's\npostgame segment. And don't worry, he's\ngoing to have plenty of charts for you.\nAnd we'll also have the new listener\nfavorite trade of the week segment right\nafter the feature interview with Matt\nBarry. and I'm Patrick Sesna with the\nmacro scoreboard week overweek as of the\nclose of Wednesday, October 8th, 2025.\nThe S&P 500 index up 63 basis points\ntrading at 6753.\nIt continues its relentless rise. We'll\ntake a closer look at that chart and the\nkey technical levels to watch in the\npostgame segment. The US dollar index up\n115 basis points trading at 98.82 82\nbreaking out above key levels, begging\nthe question if the US dollar is setting\nup for a squeeze higher. The November\nWTI crude oil contract up 125 basis\npoints, trading to 6255,\nbounced this week, but has a number of\nkey technical hurdles ahead. The\nNovember arb gasoline up 106 basis\npoints, trading at 191. The December\ngold contract up 444 basis points to\n4,070.\nGold cleared that 4,000 mark for the\nfirst time. The December copper contract\nup 430 basis points to 509, back above\n$5. And uranium down 650 basis points,\ntrading to 7765.\nThe US 10-year Treasury yield is up\nthree basis points, trading at 413. And\nthe key news to watch next week is the\nCPI and PPI inflation numbers as well as\nwatching the ongoing government shutdown\nand its impacts on the release of key\neconomic data. This week's feature\ninterview guest is freelancer.com\nfounder and CEO Matt Barry. Eric and\nMatt discuss the future of AI, the AI\nenergy consumption challenges, market\ndynamics, and AI regulations. Eric's\ninterview with Matt Barry is coming up\nas macrovoices continues right here at\nmacrovoices.com.\n[Music]\nAnd now with this week's special guest,\nhere's your host, Eric Townsend.\nJoining me now is freelancer.com CEO\nMatt Barry. Really interesting story,\nfolks, how this one came together. We\nwere trying to figure out who the top\nfive macro guests were. You already know\nabout the countdown. You know Lyn Alden\nwas the big winner. Okay, believe it or\nnot, those were just the macro guests.\nThe number one all-time download\nchampion episode of Macrovoices was\nactually a Matt Berry AI interview. And\nthe thing that's really striking to me\nis people like Luke Groman and Lyn Alden\nspent half of their careers building\ntheir following and promoting themselves\nand so forth. Matt's not even a guy who\npromotes himself, yet he's done more\ndownloads in a single episode than any\nof our guests that do. And it has to be\nthis amazing topic of artificial\nintelligence. Matt, anytime something\nlike this happens, you know, public\ninternet AI, it leads instantly to the\nobvious debate. Okay. Is this a bubble\nthat's about to burst or are we just\ngetting started or you know where are we\nin this story and and how should we\nthink about it? Is are we coming up on\nthe.com bust or are we just getting\nstarted?\n>> Well, if you think back to the dot days\nand there are a lot of parallels between\nthen and now. Cisco got to half a\ntrillion dollar market cap which is\nabout 5% of US GDP. And if you thought\nthat is a bubble, what do you think\nabout Nvidia at $4.5 trillion market cap\nand 15% of US GDP? It's become an\nabsolute behemoth. about 7 to 8% of the\nS&P 500 market valuation. They talk\nabout 6 or 7% of of revenue of the S&P\n500. It is an incredibly profitable\nbusiness. It does about $160 billion a\nyear of revenue and about 100 billion of\nEBIT, which is insane. It is built upon\na a very interesting foundation. the\nreleased in the latest financials that\nthe top two customers of Nvidia generate\naround 40% of the revenue and the next\nfour customers uh generate another 40%\nof revenue and it's believed to be that\nthe top customer is Foxcon and the\nsecond top customer is Quanta and these\nare two Taiwanese manufacturers of boxes\nthat put Nvidia chips in them and number\nthree is another Taiwanese company\ncalled Wistron and below that you know\nso your Dells and your super micros so\nyou've got an incredible customer\nconcentration the top six customers, top\nthree being from Taiwan, but the top six\ncustomers are about 80% of the revenue\nand top three customers are 50% of the\nrevenue. And then you look at their the\nproduct segments that Nvidia produces, I\nmean 80 88% of their revenue is\ncurrently coming from data centers. So\nit's it's kind of interesting and and\nand then you know out of out of the\nhundred billion dollars of EBIT the\nbiggest supplier to Nvidia is TSMC which\nhas got just like Nvidia's got 60%\nconcentration of the semiconductor\nmarket TSMC's got 70% capture of the of\nthe foundry market and so you've got\nthis incredible revenue story incredible\nrevenue growth that's all been on the\nback of data centers that's all\nconcentrated into six customers of which\nthree are in Taiwan and really the\nNvidia story which is really holding up\nthe entire market is built upon a fault\nline, one island, three customers, one\nfoundry, and a prayer that the\ngeopolitics that uh shakes Taiwan is is\nless than the geo physics underneath the\nground. So, it's it's a pretty\ninteresting thing to look at. And if you\nlook at that, so you look at that\nrevenue number of $160 billion a year,\nwhich is about $40 billion a quarter.\nThe entire AI compute space, so we're\ntalking open AI, we're talking\nmidjourney, we're talking anthropic,\netc. that entire AI compute segment in\nits totality is less than $40 billion of\nrevenue a year and every single one of\nthose companies is losing money. The\nentire ecosystem is really built around\nNvidia and a whole Taiwan story\nunderneath it. So the more you dig into\nthese numbers, which we'll do in a\nsecond, I'm sure, the more uh the\ncrazier the whole thing gets and and\nthat's in the backdrop of a pretty\nfrothy overheated market. I mean over 10\ntimes um that's already past the.com\npeak which was about 25% and and back in\nthe.com days revenue growth was was\nabout twice as high as about 20% year on\nyear. That's where we are. Um and it's\nit's kind of it's kind of interesting\nwith that basis of where we are today of\nwhat the projections are for tomorrow.\n>> Matt, this industry has already spent an\nincredible amount of capex. It seems\nlike the interest in it is unlimited.\nThere's probably unlimited capital that\nwants to chase this. Wait a minute.\nyou're going to run out of energy at\nsome point. We'll come back to that\nlater in the interview. Is capex\nunlimited? Does it limited by energy? Is\nit limited by something else? When does\nthis stop? Well, obviously there's an\nincredible amount of money being spent,\nnot just on video, but in the capex to\nbuild the data centers to put the\nmachines that have Nvidia chips in them.\nEinhorn came out this week from\nGreenlight and said this could be the\nbiggest bonfire of of money since the\nthe dotcom boom. Yeah, if you look at if\nyou look at the amount of money that the\nbig sort of hyperscalers are spending, I\nmean the likes of Microsoft and Google\nare spending at the moment around 50% of\nearnings on their capex and um you know\nthe the um Metas and the the Oracles and\nthe Amazons are projected at the moment\nto spend about 70% of their earnings on\ncapex with next year potentially up to\n1.3 times their earnings. So if you\nthink about the.com boom and you think\nabout all the telco boom and bust that\nhappened there and the optical fiber\nboom and bust that happened there you\nknow at at its peak AT&T uh when it was\nyou know dominating the market and it\nhad about I think it was about a 60%\nmarket share back then of of telecoms it\nwas spending at its peak about 72% of\nits earnings on capex and you know Exxon\nwas spending about 65% of its earnings\non capex and the shaw boom uh and kind\nof the peak of of capex so we're really\nreaching the point of of capex to\nearnings that hasn't been really\nparalleled since, you know, the the\nrailroads were laid across America. And\nthose numbers are getting to pretty\ninsane predictions. I mean, I think\nAlman came out just recently and and I\nthink um Jensen's kind of backing them\nup on up on this that they plan on\nspending by 2030 7 trillion on capex.\nNow, if this sounds like a big number,\nit is. That's about onethird of the M2\nmoney supply in the US. And how are they\ngoing to finance that? I mean a a lot of\nin fact possibly most of the capex is\nbeing financed by ads. So what are you\ngoing to do? You're going to finance $7\ntrillion of capex on banner ads. The\nadvertising market is kind of\ninteresting to look at. In the last 100\nyears, advertising as a percentage of US\nGDP has never really changed from about\na 2% level. Uh the composition of\nadvertising in that spend has changed.\nSo digital advertising now is is the\nline share. That's about 70 75% of\nadvertising spend. But you know in the\nUS it's 2% of GDP. In Australia for\nexample it's 2% of GDP. I mean worldwide\nit's about 1% of GDP. But in the rest of\nthe world you don't really have a strong\nconsumer market like you do in the US\nand so forth and western economies. So\nthere's pretty limited ability for Meta\nand Google and so forth to increase I\nthink their advertising. I don't think\nthat increasing more ads in the feed or\nplacing more banner ads on the page is\ngoing to be able to sustain a\neverinccreasing exponentially growing\ncapex spend. And if it's not ads that's\nsning this capex spend, it's cloud. And\nso, you know, you've got three major\nplayers in cloud. You've got um you AWS,\nyou've got Microsoft Azure. And I was\nvery surprised actually to see that in\nthe last quarter, Microsoft's actually\nhave taken Amazon um in terms of in\nterms of the revenue. It's about I think\n$47 billion in the quarter versus um AWS\nis 29 billion. And then third place,\nyou've got Google Cloud. And you know,\nfor a long time, there were there were\npretty decent margins. But now with you\nknow the AI you know sort of capex boom\nthose margins are eroding quite\ndramatically as the capex spends ramping\nthrough the roof and you've got now um\nfourth and fifth players coming into the\nmarket. So you've got Oracle now trying\nto enter the market and they're trying\nto do it on price. So they're saying\nthey're going to undercut um you know\nthe cost by about 40%. And then behind\nthat you've got sort of corewave and the\nand the neo clouds coming in and and if\nyou reflect back on the dotcom days um\nyou AT&T had one analyst I think said\nyou know better better profit margins\nand and drug dealing you know when when\nit was just three players in the market\nand they had 60% market share you know\nand again you know that's kind of the\nmarket share that Microsoft has in\nsoftware and that's the market share\nthat Nvidia has in AI and it's the\nmarket share that TSMC has in foundaries\nand now you look back at the telecoms\nboom when the fourth player and the\nfifth players came in you know all the\neconom omics just fell apart because of\nthe capex. So, you know, you've got that\ndynamic happening now in the in the\nmarket for AI data center buildout. And\nthe funny thing behind all of this, it's\nthe demand isn't there, you know,\nthey're all building this out a ahead of\ntime. And if the if the money is not\ncoming from banner ads and it's not\ncoming from cloud, it's coming from VCs.\nSo, you've got huge amounts of money\nslloshing to the space, the numbers are\nabsolutely astronomical. You know,\nNvidia, I I said they're doing a 160\nbillion a year in in in revenue and the\nthe rest of the AI compute space is\nmaking less than 40 billion in in\ntotality and and losing money. Well,\neach of these big hyperscalers, they're\nspending, you know, anticipated to spend\nnext year, you know, hundred billion\nplus or minus 20 billion on capex alone\nand they're not even doing that in\nrevenue. I mean, AWS at the moment is\ndoing about 110 billion a year in\nrevenue and that's going to be spent in\nits entirety next year on capex just\njust by each of the hyperscalers. So\nthese numbers are astronomical. I mean\nin the back in the dotcom days at least\nwhen you had that boom the software\nmarket generated around 300 billion of\nrevenue in its totality and employed\nabout a million people. I mean this AI\nboom is generating what 20 30 billion a\nyear in revenue. It's hard to tell\nbecause all the companies are private.\nUh losing money and not employing\nanywhere near as that that level. And in\nfact if anything they're saying we're\ngoing to take everyone's jobs away uh\nand create unemployment. So, you know,\nthe numbers are very fantastical and the\nmore you dig into that, the more you dig\ninto just how big those numbers are. I\nmean, I just saw literally about an hour\nago, Mark Andre tweeted a um an\ninteresting graph. it was um uh US real\nGDP growth contribution from tech capex\nand at the moment in the second quarter\nof 2025 the US real GDP growth is around\n2% peranom and half of that is capex\nfrom big tech and they want to lift that\ncapex from 400 million to um a 7\ntrillion spend by 2030 in in totality\nMatt as you know energy investing is my\npersonal passion and I got to tell you\nthis AI one is a completely different\nballgame than anything else I've looked\nat I'm not really thinking about okay\nwhat's the demand of this and the supply\nof that. I'm thinking this fundamentally\nchanges society in a way where\npotentially AI consumes so much energy\nand it needs it to grow that it\nexacerbates an energy price escalation\nthat I think was coming due to inflation\nanyway. And all of a sudden you've got\neverybody feeling like AI is both\nstealing our jobs and consuming our\nenergy. It has to be outlawed. It has to\nbe shut down. And I think it potentially\nadds to a social divide that's already\nkind of out of control. So to me,\nthere's almost nothing you could say\nabout the scope of how much energy it's\ngoing to use or what the consequence of\nthat could be that would surprise me. I\nhave to admit though, I'm kind of a\nnarrative oriented guy. I haven't done\nenough homework to have any data to back\nthe things I'm saying. Am I crazy to\nthink it's that big? And how big is it?\n>> Well, in all these things, in all these\nbubbles, you have blue sky and then you\nhave reality. And energy is kind of\nwhere the reality uh practically starts\nto hit. You know, data centers are are\ndrawing huge amounts of energy from the\ngrid. In the US already, it's about 4.5%\nof the whole US energy demand uh and\nproject to go to 9% by 2030. And this is\nat a scale now that it's causing real\nproblems for a lot of different\ncountries around the world. In fact, I\nmean, Bloomberg just came out with about\na week or so ago with a an analysis of\nuh energy prices in the US and they\nfound within within vicinity of data\ncenters, I think they looked at, you\nknow, within 70 km of a data center, um\nthey did a survey of wholesale energy\nprices in the United States and they\nshowed that within the last 5 years that\nthose prices have gone up 267%.\nSo, you can imagine the average person\nin the streets probably not very happy\nwith their if their bills go by triple\nto power someone else's chatbots. Uh at\nthe same time, you know, it takes a long\ntime to put energy generation on the\ngrid. It's highly political as you as\nyou well know. I mean, you were just out\nhere in Australia and even though we're\nan energy superpower in five different\ncapabilities, you know, uranium, coal,\ngas, we've got some oil, etc. We're not\nallowed to use most of it. You know,\nwe're shutting down coal plants, etc.\nSo, it's very hard to get new supply on\nthe grid. You know, the average data\ncenter now is what 300 400 megawatts\ngoing to a gigawatt. If you try and put\nthat on a lot of city grids, you'll\nbrand it out. So, in addition to grid\ncap capacity problems and energy price\nproblems, you've just got the practical\nreality of building these things, right?\nI mean, Schneider Electric has an order\nbook backed out till 2030. So, I don't\nknow how they're going to get this\ncapex, you know, done. At the moment,\nthey're drawing down the capacity that's\ncome from the office market rolling off.\nSo as the work from home and the co\nthing kind of get you know the office\nmarket in in uh in the US and other\nplaces around the world there is some\nconstruction capacity that's been drawn\ndown to to build these data centers but\nif you can't get the you know electrical\ntransformers and the switching equipment\nand you can't get the builder to to be\navailable at any reasonable price to\nbuild the data center and then on top of\nthat you know AI demand is moving\nelectricity markets like OPEC used to\nmove oil you're going to have some real\nproblems in terms of your ability to\nactually deploy this and then at the end\nof the day the economics aren't there\nbecause no one's making any money yet\nother than Nvidia. you've got this whole\ninfrastructure that is built upon a\ngreat story um a great promise and I do\nthink in the long run it's very similar\nto com boom in that you know I think I\nsaid this in the last one of the last\nmacro voices episodes right Cisco you\nknow networks networks that's that's\ntheir motto that's their tagline the\ninternet got deployed around the western\neconomies people thought you know\neverything's going to be on the internet\nyou know your clothing will be connected\nyou know personal area network to your\nwatch to your handheld device to this\nthat the other to your computer to the\nto the world and Cisco makes all the\nrouters the switches the hubs and\nultimately the chips that will network\nthe fabric of of of mankind and\nindustry. And so they're going to be the\nrichest company in the world. And kind\nof look at AI and it's a very similar\nissue where you kind of go think well AI\nis going to power everything. It's great\nfor highly personalizing experiences and\nand really taking automation to the next\nlevel, you know, which is the very\nessence of computer science. And um but\nwe may be getting ahead ahead of\nourselves in the stories here. You've\nobviously got some personalities that\nare great, you know, showman. I mean Sam\nAlman's the you one of the PT Barnums of\nour time in terms of weaving a story and\ntelling a story but um the numbers now\nare so fantastical and so large and just\nso incredulous that you have real\nconstraints in the physical world\nbuilding up with numbers that get you\nkeep adding zeros to them and then at\nthe end of the day that may be way ahead\nof where the current usage is in time\njust like you know we had the telecoms\nblow up and the and the dotcom boom you\nknow the law of computing basically is\nthat you know ultimately you will use up\nall the memory, all the bandwidth, all\nthe disc space, you know, all the CPU\ncapability available to you, but it may\ntake time some time to get there and you\nmay have a massive over capacity for a\nperiod of time as people get over\nexuberant. At the beginning of the\npublic internet and the then the\nensuing.com bubble and so forth, there\nwas a lot of contention over completely\nunorthodox business models, Google\ngiving all kinds of things away just to\nestablish market share, which seemed\ncrazy, but it was actually very\neffective. It seems to me like we're\ngoing through the same thing again. And\nI I got to tell you, I went from Chat\nGPT3, I kind of felt like it's a cool\nnovelty, but I'm not going to spend 20\nbucks a month on this thing. Now, at\nChatJPT5, I've got the $200\nsubscription. I wouldn't go down to the\n20 if you paid me to uh because I just\neven for that small little edge, I I\nreally value it and I would frankly love\nto to be offered the $500 a month option\nbecause I've come to use it so much.\nOkay. If they're mostly only able to\nsell the $20 option, is this business\nstaying? I mean, how do they make money\ndoing this? It's clear that there's no\nsustainable business model with a\nfoundational model at this point in\ntime. I mean, there's zero switching\ncosts. You know, if OpenAI, you know,\ndeep research, you know, um 03 is better\nthan, you know, Sonnet, whatever from\nClaude, I immediately switch my activity\nthere. And I'm I'm sure you do the same\nas you just go to whatever the latest\ngreatest is. There's nothing holding you\nback. And so it what's very obvious\nthough as you become more of a power\nuser and I and I do spend a lot of my\nday admittedly in in GPT you making all\nsorts of queries etc. when you kind of\nrun out of uh usage in your $20 plan or\nyour $200 plan or whatever the plan is,\nthe platforms don't say, \"Please put in\nyour credit card and buy more credit.\"\nThey say, \"You're on a timeout in the\nnaughty corner for 6 hours, 7 hours, six\nsix days.\" And in some circumstances, I\nwas given a several week timeout on one\nof the platforms. So, you can tell that\nthey're actually the unit economics of\ninference is is not there. They're not\nmaking money on you actually using the\nproduct. It's it's more like a gym\nmembership. they're making money and you\nnot turning up and paying the\nsubscription. And this is this is a real\ntangible problem that you're getting\nlike this incredible uh buildout and\ndata center usage for companies that\nthat are completely unprofitable. And\nyou may be willing to pay $500 a month\nfor greater usage of your model. I would\nthink that would still probably be\nunprofitable in your usage at that\nlevel. You know, are you prepared to pay\n2,000 a month, 20,000 a month or\nwhatever the true number is for\nprofitability? I don't I I don't know.\nyou know one one of the one of the big\nusagea use cases that coming out now\nwhich is which is burning a lot of\ntokens are these sort of you know AI\nenabled you know integrated development\nenvironments so you see like your\ncursors and so forth where programmers\ncan get autocomplete on steroids\neffectively writing software cursor\nmakes no money on on that token burn\nthey've got an incredible revenue ramp\nrate in fact they're the one of the only\num three companies in the entire AI\ncompute space that has um $500 million a\nyear or more of annual recurring revenue\nand you know note annual recurring\nrevenue not revenue um there's a lot of\nfunny calculations being used to kind of\num project the hype but uh 100% of Kurs'\nrevenue is sent to Anthropic who\nprovides the underlying foundational\nmodel to basically power their product\nand you know they're not making money\nanthropic is not making any money\nthey're losing money losing billions a\nyear etc and you know at this point in\ntime even companies like Perplexity is\nsending\n165% of their revenue to the um\nunderlying foundational model providers\nto run their search service. Uh and then\nthose foundational models providers are\nare sending it off to the the cloud\ncomputing guys who are sending it off\neffectively to Nvidia who's sending it\nto TSMC. So what do these so what do\nthese companies have to do? So the open\nAI the world they've come out now saying\nokay we're not we're not going to make\nany money on $20 a month. We're not\nmaking any money on $200 a month. We\nhave to come out with some sort of a\nstory to justify these skyhigh\nvaluations. Now, I will note that OpenAI\nhas raised about $64 billion worth of\nmoney, I think, today. And so, and and\nthey've done it at a $300 billion\nvaluation. They're about to sell some\nemployee stock. I think they've they're\nupsizing the employee um sellown around\nat half a trillion dollar valuation. So,\nit's interesting. The Open AI guys are\nkind of cashing out, you know, by the\ntime that's done, they'll cash out about\n11 something billion dollars worth of\nstock, and they're only doing about four\nbillion of revenue and a half, four\nbillion of revenue and a half, and\nthey're losing eight in the first half\nof this year. So to promise to provide a\njustification for these skyh high\nvaluations, they've got to come up with\nthese these fantastical stories. And the\nlatest story I saw from Zwman about two\nweeks ago was that 40% of people will\npotentially have their jobs taken uh\nthanks to AI. And by the implication of\nthat, what he's saying is that open AI\nwill generate the income that 40% of\npeople would in the past be paid and\nthat's going to be the revenue stream in\nthe future as they kind of take over all\nthese different categories of work. Now,\nif that were remotely true, uh they\nwould launch jihad on uh on SAM. They'll\nburn down the Open AI headquarters and\nthey'll put an access to their data\ncenters and governments would would\nregulate and ban it, right? I mean, the\nGreat Depression uh unemployment was\naround 32%. And so, these numbers are\nextreme. And to date, I still don't know\nof and I know there's dislocation that's\ngoing to come in certain segments, but I\nstill don't know someone amongst any of\nmy friends um or even online who could\nput their hand up and truthfully say\nI've lost my job thanks to AI despite\nall these stories around, you know,\nagents and so forth and so on. Now, I do\nthink it's going to come in in some\nparts. I think you know in customer\nsupport uh in some areas of sales in\nsome areas of um administrative work\nwhere people have highly paralyzable\ntaskbased workflows which lend\nthemselves very highly to automation and\nvery very good automation I will say\nbecause remember the whole art of\nsoftware is around automation. So you\nknow this is really just taking things\nreally to you know a 10x step up and I\nthink you can do some of those taskbased\nfunctions very very well. You know it's\nstill it's still not there yet. I mean,\nnobody is making a profit doing doing\nthis. Yes, but it is coming. Um, but\nit's not going to be on the scale of 40%\nof the world people the people in the\nworld being unemployed. And so you've\ngot this, if you just step back and just\nlook at the ecosystem, right? So you got\nNvidia 160 billion in in in revenue, 100\nbillion in earnings. they're making bank\nand then you got this a whole ecosystem\naround them basically pumping Nvidia to\nthe moon uh in terms of their revenue\nand and and by by result of that their\nvaluation. None of that around them is\nmaking any money. You've got OpenAI\npitching all sorts of fantastical\nthings. You got to remember that they\nstill have to revenue share with\nMicrosoft. Uh they're still a nonprofit\nthis that the other but they're talking\nabout trillion dollars a year of of\ncapex 7 trillion by 2030. There's the\nwhole Oracle deal which we should talk\nabout in a second etc. And they don't\nhave the money for any of this stuff and\num it's almost it kind of feels much\nbigger than Enron in terms of the of of\nthe look and feel of the whole story\naround open AI and all the all the funny\nthings that are happening now around the\nfinancings in the space and the\njustifications for how the capex is\ngoing to be going to occur. Um and by\nexample of that there was um what\nthey're calling now on social media. I\nthink Elon called it the infinite money\nglitch. You've got this announcement\nannouncement by Oracle that have just\ncome out. So, you know, the other day\nOracle share price jumped by about 39%.\nUh because they had like this big it was\nlike 380 or so billion dollars worth of\ncloud compute bookings that they've got\nout till 20 2030 or so. Now, Oracle\nhasn't built their cloud yet. They're\nsaying they're going to build one. They\nsay they're going to do it on the price\ncompetitive approach of of, you know,\nroughly a 40% discount, etc. Uh but they\nthey showed this order book and the\norder book was quite quite interesting\nactually when it came out because it was\nlike a hockey stick you know I think it\nwas like 2026 it was like 18 billion in\nin in in bookings and then the next year\nwas 32 billion the next year was 73\nbillion the next year was 14 billion and\n144 billion and so they showed this huge\nhockey stick ramp and their share price\nwent up 39% but then like a day or so\nlater I think it was a Wall Street\nJournal published that 300 billion of\nthat is open AI Now, open Open AI is\nonly doing was it $4 billion a quarter\nof revenue. They don't have $300 billion\nto spend. But what they've done is\nthey've done they've done this deal with\nOracle where they go they've committed\nto this order book and off the back of\nthat, you know, Oracle share price has\npumped and and then then in par parallel\nwith all of that, so Jensen's come out\nand he's he's now offering this is the\ninfinite money glitch. So he he's\noffering a hundred billion worth of GPUs\nto Nvidia under vendor financing. So\nhe's effectively saying take the GPUs\nnow, pay me later for them. And then\nwhat OpenAI has done with those with\nthose GPUs is gone to Corewave. And\nCoree is a Neo cloud. We'll talk about\nthem in a second. That's like the the\nnew generation cloud AWS's and Azour and\nand so forth. And it's gone to them and\nsaid, \"Okay, well, I've got these\nhundred billion dollars of GPUs. I'll\ngive them to you to kind of to to use\nand I will book with you $22 billion\nworth of compute over the next couple of\nyears and that'll be take or pay. So\nI'll I'll lock that in and I'll\nguarantee that I'll spend $22 billion\nwith you. Coreweave is then going off\nand going look at look at my bookings.\nI've got $22 billion of the bookings.\nAnd then open eye on the flip side\nsaying look I've got $22 billion of\ncommitted spend I'm going to make on\ncompute. So I must have a big customer\npipeline. So pump my valuation and give\nme you know a skyhigh you half a\ntrillion dollar thing so I can do 11\nbillion stock sell down. And then\nCoreweave is saying well I've got 22\nbillion of bookings from from OpenAI.\nI'm going to go to the private credit\nmarkets and JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs\nand and so forth, and I'm going to raise\nmoney in the debt markets from private\ncredit, the lender of last resort. And\nwhat I'm going to do with that is I'm\ngoing to take that money and I'm going\nto go back to Nvidia and I'm going to\nbuy the data center, you know, gear that\nto build out my my um u AI GPU powered\ndata centers and the money just goes\naround in a circle and at no point in\ntime yet has a single customer spent a\ndollar. And so you you look at all of\nthat and you kind of go well if you\nsanity check the numbers and there's\nactually a really interesting blog\ncalled where's your ed at which I\nencourage everyone to read where\nsomeone's gone looked into this in far\nmore detail um and just gone through the\nnumbers etc and so forth and and if you\nbelieve the Oracle story and if you\nbelieve about this $300 billion in spend\nthen what that means is is that in five\nyears Oracle is going to single-handedly\ngrow the AI compute market 500%. They're\ngoing to take it from sub40 billion to\n200 billion. They are going to overtake\nAWS, you know, by I think 2029 withund\nAWS does about 115 billion a year in in\nrevenue and and and by 2029, Oracle is\npredicting they're going to do that from\ntheir cloud business and then overtake\nit to 144. So, they're going to do that\nand the whole thing is going to come\nfrom one customer being Open AI who\ndoesn't have the money. And I asked you\nbefore coming in here, I just checked\nOracle's balance sheet. Oracle is a big\nbusiness. They've only got a billion 11\nbillion in cash. So these numbers of\nhundred billion a year of of capex for\neach of these companies, 400 billion up\nuntil now, 7 trillion being a third of\nthe M3 money supply that some is going\nto be financed with ads or cloud or VCs.\nI mean, the numbers are just insane. And\nit all this infrastructure and all this\nwhole environment is now is built around\nNvidia who's making all the money. is\nthe only one making any money other than\nTSMC. And then you got this new paradigm\ncoming in with the um the Neoclouds,\nright? So the Neoclouds, that's\nCoreweave, it's Lambda, and it's Nebian.\n>> Matt, hang on a second. Neoclouds, I\nhave to admit I don't know that one.\nFill us in.\n>> Well, it's one of those things where,\nyou know, from time to time, I kind of\nbrowse the internet and I kind of see\nthese new businesses that pop up that\nlook like they're very, very large\nbusinesses and I just kind of think\nthink to myself, I must be really stupid\nor just not understand. And so you kind\nof you know read through the website and\nand and so forth and you go wow this is\nkind of really cool. It's like really\nadvanced. It's really huge. This is a\nwhole industry I didn't know about.\nThese are next generation cloud\ncomputing providers. So these guys are\naiming to provide the GPU powered\nversion of AWS or Azure. And they're\ncoming into the market as sort of the\nfifth entrance the sixth entrance and\nseventh entrance to compete against\nthose those incumbents. And the\ninteresting thing about these companies\nare obviously I've talked about the\ninfinite money glitch where it seems to\nbe like a a bit of a circle jerk going\nbetween you know Nvidia Open AAI Core\nand they're all kind of using the same\nmoney that's just slloshing around in a\nin a in a circle. these neurocclouds,\nthey're kind of like the wei works of\nGPUs, right? It's basically take take in\nsome pre-bookings, use those\npre-bookings to raise some raise some\nmoney, rinse, repeat, and go in a\ncircle. And these guys are building out\ninfrastructure and they've got they've\ngot huge spend. I think they're spending\nabout $50 billion a quarter those three.\nThey're financed by the uh by Nvidia and\nby the the customers are Nvidia. So for\nexample, super micro funded lambda and\nthey're basically just building out data\ncenters that are GPU powered doing so in\na very much a build it and they will\ncome sort of business model because to\nthe best of uh anyone's knowledge at the\npoint of time not not really making any\nmoney outside of your traditional open\nAIS metas and of course Nvidia itself um\nand it' be interesting to see where\nNvidia is going with this because\nbecause ultimately it feels that\nJensen's heading towards a his own\nfoundational model being being launched\non Nvidia hardware, but we'll see if\nthat if that happens or not. But the\nthese these these um NeoCloud providers\nare basically trying to enter the market\nand uh through price pricing and through\narguably a better product because it's\nusing Nvidia GPUs rather than\nnutritional CPUs etc. Basically trying\nto enter the market and capture you know\npotential huge revenue streams in the\nfuture that may or may not eventuate.\nSo, you know, I think I think uh CO has\nspent this year about $20 billion uh\nbuilding out their infrastructure and it\nand um yeah, it just feels it feels like\na very very strange uh business model if\nyou kind of get to the bottom of it.\n>> Matt, I want to move on to the social\nimplications of this. I'm as I get my\nhead around this, I'm increasingly\nconvinced this is much bigger almost\nthan anybody is thinking about or\ntalking about. And I'll use this idea of\nthe so-called competency crisis that\npeople have talked about. Uh, let's use\nUber as an example. You know, back in\nthe day, getting a job as a limousine\ndriver required a fair amount of skill.\nYou had to make sure you knew how to\nfind addresses and so forth. Well, they\ndumbed that job down to the point where\nit's just so idiot proof with a moving\nmap in front of your face that shows you\nexactly where to go that just about\nanybody can be an Uber driver. And my\nprediction is AI is going to make it so\nthat just about any numbum skull who's\ngot some kind of of device that they can\nuse AI for is suddenly qualified to do\nall kinds of jobs that they might not\neven understand, but they can still get\nthrough it because they got AI to coach\nthem. It's like they've got their own\npersonal little coach for it. If that's\nwhere we're headed, I think it dumbs\ndown society. Why the heck would you\nwant to graduate high school or be\nbother finishing never mind going to\nuniversity if a lot of the jobs that are\nout there you just need to learn to\noperate AI and you know that's it. So is\nthat where it's headed or or or what do\nyou think the social implications can be\nof this just huge explosion of AI into\nsociety? Well, and in in some regards,\nare we going to see a huge spike in the\nDunning Krueger effect as a result of\neveryone becoming expert in 15 seconds\nfrom quering something on JBC without\ndoing the hard work to learn something\nover a period of years? Look, what I see\nis, oh, I mean, generally what we are\nseeing, so I've got 83 million people in\nmy marketplace who using AI on for every\ntype of job you can imagine. Now, I\nmean, we're seeing a big lift in skills,\nright? So, you know, I think I've said\nthis before, if you're an average\ncopyriter, you're now an exceptional\ncopyriter with GP Chord. If you're an\naverage um illustrator now, you can\nbecome exceptional quite quickly with,\nyou know, your mid journeys and the\nlike. The same thing is going to happen\nin all the white collar trades, whether\nyou're a programmer or whether you're a,\nyou know, industrial designer or an\narchitect or or what have you. So, it\ndoes dramatically the skills of people.\nI think it's like the world be when when\nyou went to work and I I was kind of\njust at the cusp of this when I kind of\nentered the workforce where you kind of\nyou you enter the workforce and there\nused to be no computer on your desk\nduring the day and then you came to work\nand there was a computer on everyone's\ndesk and all of a sudden everyone was a\nlot more productive and so forth and\nyeah you had some dislocation and a lot\nof jobs kind of went away then the\ntyping pools of secretaries and large\ncompanies disappeared but they got\nredeployed etc ultimately to different\njobs etc. I do think that skills lift.\nWe're seeing a lot of productivity.\nWe're seeing a lot of liquidity. So, for\nexample, you know, our contest\nfunctionality where people can, you\nknow, put up a prize and people compete\nfor the prize and we do that all the way\nfrom, you know, simple things like logos\nright up to, you know, $6 million gene\nediting um invasion challenge for the\nNIH. We are seeing a lot of entries\ncoming in a lot faster, a lot quicker, a\nlot higher quality. In fact, we had to\nrecently rate limit that because we're\ngetting over 700 entries per contest. So\nwe're getting a liquidity effect, you\nknow, and a speed effect as well as a\nquality effect and a bang for buck\neffect. So So all in all, you can\nprobably encapsulate in the word\nproductivity um goes through the roof.\nBut yes, on one hand, you know, if\nyou're at university and you used to\ncheat by looking up Google, the answers,\nyou know, that cheating is now on\nsteroids by getting GBT to do stuff for\nyou. And and and that's certainly going\nto going to continue. And you know, if\nyou get your, you know, big brother to\ndo your homework or you get Google to do\nyour homework or you get Wolf from Alpha\nto do your homework or you get GBT to do\nyour homework. Yeah. And you're not\nlearning the materials, you're going to\nreally really suffer. The flip side of\nthat is that AI is going to be probably\nthe most powerful forces in history for\neducation in that it will be able to\npersonalize a lesson plan for you. And\njust like you know what your pace is\nthat you want to learn at and I know\nyour you Eric are very very good at\nasking the right questions to really\nmaximize your learning rate on a new\ntopic or a new area and so forth. And\nthe same for me you know it does have\nthe power particularly is from the you\nknow the high school to tertiary\neducation and above really empower the\nability for people to learn new skills,\nnew trades, new knowledge super quick.\nNow the question is just going to be and\nthat and this is this is this is one of\nthe questions the trillion dollar\nquestion that you kind of look at when\nyou know a lot of these AI guys hype\nthese models to the moon is will the AI\nbe able to create new knowledge and do\nyou know independent scientific research\nand come up with new things and new\ninventions and will we enter this sort\nof hyped up AGI super super singularity\nsort of event horizon or is it just a\nreally really good autocomplete that may\nbe better better than any autocomplete\nthat you ever seen in your life. While\nit can find correlations and this that\nthe other, it does struggle to kind of\nfind new advances, you know, to push\nscientific breakthroughs. That that\nthat's going to be the big question. And\nI and I I use the litma test for that.\nYou know, will we see sort of creativity\nemerge from these models? And you know,\nfor example, will there be a song\ntrending in the top 100 soon that's\ngoing to be completely done by by AI\ndesigned, composed, produced, and\nexecuted and deployed by AI? Are we are\nwe going to start seeing that with\nliterature? Are we going to see start\nseeing that with with music? Are we\ngoing to start seeing it with\nentertainment? If that starts to happen\num you know we might also be be there\nwith scientific progress and technical\nadvances or is it going to start capping\nout and there are real fundamental\nlimits uh on access to data which is\nfundamental you know I mean all the\ncheap oil of data has kind of been m you\nknow drilled out and used to train these\nmodels now you know increasingly there's\nthere's there's tariffs rules\nregulations and restrictions on ability\nto use it and is that going to be which\nis required exponentially more you know\nwith every generation of the models are\ncoming out is going to be the\nfundamental limit. And in fact, yeah, we\nget a computer on our desk, that\ncomputer is faster, better, 10x better\nthan you've ever seen before. Uh, and\neveryone's going to be super productive,\nbut there is going to be a limit where\nis go from here, particularly in in the\npractical reality that the underlying\neconomics of this AI at scale is not\nactually working.\n>> You mentioned something at the beginning\nof that answer I want to come back to,\nwhich is the fire hose, the excess\namount of productivity. I've felt this\nmyself, Matt, on your platform. I've\nbeen using freelancer.com for several\nyears now. If I need logos, graphic\nthings I'm really bad at, just hire\nsomebody. It's amazing to me using the\ncontest function. A few years ago, when\nI started using that, boy, I could put\nup a $100 contest and a whole bunch of\nwell-qualified designers would submit\nover just a few hours. I'd have a bunch\nof really interesting designs. I get to\npick one, the guy gets a hundred bucks.\nIt was just a great deal. Well, recently\nI thought, hey, I'm going to up it to\n300 bucks and uh I really want to do a\ngood one this time. What I had no idea\nwas coming, Matt, is if you put a $300\ncontest on freelancers.com,\nyou better have a staff of people ready\nto help you sort through the thousands\nand thousands of submissions you're\ngoing to get. It's that much. And it's\nliterally to the point where I feel like\nI need AI in order to filter all of the\nAI proposals because all of the sudden\nthat freelancer community has so much\ncapacity that I literally can't give\neach designer a fair shake or a fair\nchance because there's just so much\ncoming and I mean that's a good thing\nkind of but it all presents a problem.\n>> Yeah. Know when you when you mention\n$300 in graphic design you got to be\noverwhelmed. So, I mean, I sabotaged\nmyself by paying to and and think about\nit just a few years ago. 300 bucks if\nyou wanted a logo done by a professional\ngraphic designer where you're going to\nget one person's best attempt and they\nwere going to put a few hours into it.\nThat used to cost 500 bucks. I only put\n300 bucks in the contest. And the result\nwas I almost couldn't use any result\nbecause in order to I mean, not that I\ndidn't get plenty of value back for my\n300 bucks, but I didn't have time to\nsort through it all and pick one in\ntime.\n>> Yeah. We we recently had to deploy\nsomething to actually rate limit uh the\nability for people to to enter in\ncontests and we could use AI to actually\nsort through and and and so forth and\nrank and and and so forth. But also as\nthe reputation system as well we order\nall the entries now by um basically the\nquality of of past work of the\nparticular entrance. But you are right.\nI mean we're definitely seeing a lift in\nnot just the quality of work that people\nproduce but the speed at which they can\nactually do it and ultimately the bang\nfor buck bang for money. I mean what we\nhave is an incredibly deflationary\nbusiness. You know I think NASA\npublished a white paper a while ago\nbetween 80 and 99% uh of what they\ntraditionally pay are going to\ntraditional labor arrangements and we\nare steps to make it manageable because\nthere is an absolute explosion in\nproductivity. Matt final question tell\nme about Sam Alman uh your sense of him\nhis sincerity his intentions uh whether\nhe's a good guy or a bad guy. I I have\nto admit I can't read it. I thought his\ninterview with Tucker Carlson was\nincredibly revealing. I'm not sure\nexactly of which. And there was a tweet\nalso which really kind of got my\nattention because I've seen this before.\nI know over you know you guys in\nAustralia went through this with social\nmedia and oh well we we need to protect\nthe children. We we we need to protect\nthe children from profanity and bad\nthings on social media. So therefore,\neverybody is not allowed to use it until\nthey identify to the government with a\ngovernment ID exactly who you are before\nyou're allowed to log into your social\nmedia site. Sounds to me like Sam Alman\nis pushing for the same thing for AI and\nI don't trust his intentions. Am I being\nparanoid? And more broadly, what do you\nthink of this guy?\n>> Yeah, I think you always always have to\nkind of take a look at the what's been\nsaid and kind of just think about it\nkind of carefully and think through kind\nof what what's really going on. There's\nthis I'll take I'll take this the second\nquestion first and we can come back to\nthe Tucker Carlson interview. So he said\nthat I think in the context of the was\nhe was saying that um they're going to\nallow adult content on open AI and as a\nresult of that they need to protect the\nchildren and therefore they're going to\ndo you know age verification. Well\nthere's a few things going on there.\nObviously, Elon has been using um\nsexualization of content, I guess, for\none of a better word, on Grock to try\nand encourage a bit of a cult following\nof the Gro AI.\n>> But but hang on, time out. There there's\njust only one sane way to do that, which\nis to say if you want the adult content,\nthen you can opt in at your sole\npersonal discretion to to show your ID.\nThat's not what he's pushing for. He's\nsaying everybody has to show their ID in\norder to be able to use the thing\nbecause they're not going to It doesn't\nmake sense. Yeah. So, so on one hand,\nAirlines kind of saying, \"Well, we can\nget a Grockas uncensored.\" And I I think\nif you if you look at the sustainable\ncompetitive dev advantages between the\nfoundational AI models, there's\nbasically none. They all do the same\nthing. They all can write a story for\nyou. They all can um give you advice.\nThey can all generate an image, etc. The\nonly different competitive advantage is\nhow censored they are and how leftwing\nbiased they are in the the training,\nright? and and Elon's kind of said,\nwell, you can come to Grock and you\nknow, you can you can talk about\nanything and we're not going to censor\nyou and and that that's my that's my\nadvantage. Now, maybe Sam is saying to\nhimself, well, you know, the internet, I\nthink last time someone published\nsomething, you know, 80% of the traffic\non the internet is Pornhub. And so maybe\non one hand, you know, Sam's saying,\nokay, well, how do I get usage up of my\nAI? And what are people potentially\nwilling to pay for? I don't know. Maybe\nwe'll go into kind of like the, you\nknow, the pornographic style content and\nmaybe that will get more people\nsubscribing and more usage. I don't\nknow. What I think is probably really\ngoing on is, you know, in Australia, for\nexample, we've got a um effectively a\ncensorship um division of government,\nwhich is run by someone who's nicknamed\nEar. And in December of this year, the\nlaw comes in place uh which has already\npassed through government under the\nguise of protecting the kids. every\nsingle social media platform uh in the\nworld that operates in Australia will\nneed to do age verification to prove\nthat you are not uh under 16. Now that\nhas absolutely do nothing to do with\nprotecting the kids and everything to do\nwith requiring digital ID to be rolled\nout in Australia so that everyone on the\ninternet can be identified um as you\nknow the the the the source of of a\ncomment you on on Twitter or on a\nYouTube video or whatever it may be. In\nfact, our prime minister Anthony Albanzy\nwas some years ago, there's a there's a\nclip online where he was asked if he was\never going to be dictated for a day,\nwhat's the one thing he'll do? And he\nsaid, \"Ban social media because he's not\nso thick skinned and um you know,\ndoesn't like people talking about things\non the on on the internet about him.\"\nSo, this law is coming in now. The\ntantrums are going to be insane.\nObviously, they just tried banning\nsocial media and was it Nepal and\neveryone rioted and set fire to\nparliament and so forth. But the\nramifications of trying to stop people\nsaying nasty things on the internet is\nmore than just X and Facebook and\nInstagram and so forth. Um the e safety\ncommission there is now looking at\nwhether to ban Roblox, Legoland and\nGitHub because they're all places that\npeople can leave comments etc. So that\nshows you how kind of insane this law\nis. And so by virtue of that they've\nalso said they're going to require it\nfor search engines. Now AI is basically\na modern version of a search engine. And\nyou know while we have not seen I think\nyet substantial deviation away from\nGoogle and the traditional search\nengines to the chat like interfaces for\nsearch that's basically what a lot of\npeople are predicting and I I believe\nthe reason he's rolling out the age\nverification is because he knows that\nthe e- safety regulator is going to\nrequire uh them to um do age\nverification and you know Starmer over\nin the UK is now trying to push digital\nID as a excuse to of what what he needs\nin place in order to solve the um mass\nimmigration problem that he's been\nrunning at full speed over there as\nwell. And it's causing all sorts of\nsocial unrest. And he's saying, \"Well,\nthese people coming across from Africa\ninto into the UK. We can't stop them\nfrom working unless we have digital ID.\"\nAlthough he was pulled up this week, uh\nsaid, \"Well, they've got to show a\nnational insurance card.\" And if they're\nnot doing that, they're getting work\nanyway uh from, you know, doing\nillegally working and not showing an\ninsurance card. How's digital ID going\nto help? They're still going to work the\nsame way. But um yeah, I think I you\ndon't know what's going on there. there\nmaybe a few thing a bit confluence of\nevents but I kind of feels that he's\njust getting ahead of um that because\nthere's quite substantial fines for the\ncompanies that allow kids to operate on\nthem and it'll be interesting to see\nwhere where it plays out or whether\nthey're actually going to ban GitHub and\nyeah I mean I come home and watch\nYouTube at night sometimes I watch\nprospecting videos and geology videos\nand how to repair old electronic\nequipment or what have you fantastic\nresource for kids and but yeah they're\ngoing to ban it so um I get the feeling\nthat that they're just going to have to\napply that rule to open eye as well in\nregards to your first question. I mean,\nI was pretty amazed by the Tucker\nCarlson interview. I mean, isn't Tucker\nan incredible interviewer?\n>> That interview pissed me off because we\nhad this scheduled and I was thinking to\nmyself, boy, we are going to rock it,\nMatt. We're going to do the best AI\ninterview ever done. And Tucker blew me\naway cuz that guy is not technical at\nall. And he absolutely nailed that\ninterview. It was like a story arc\nrivaling Breaking Bad. Watching that\ninterview and just just how you set it\nup and and kind of it was, you know, for\nthose who haven't watched, I highly\nencourage you you you watch it. It's is\nincredible work of art from Tucker.\nYeah, it was kind of interesting. You\nknow, obviously all these guys who run\nthese, you know, you know, multi-billion\ndollar companies talk a big game. They\nneed to talk a big game because, you\nknow, the the whole venture space is\nkind of like a obeys a power law of\ninvesting. you got to kind of swing for\nthe swing for the bleaches and you got\nto get one investment to return a\nphenomenal amount of money to make any\nto make a make a return in your\nportfolio. Um so they all talk huge\ngains whether it's Elon, whether it's\nSam, whether whoever it is. Um but yeah\nit and so he kind of um he started off\nasking him just just things about you\nknow have you seen higher powers of is\nthere something spiritual happening\ninside the AI? Are they alive? they and\nso forth and kind of was kind of setting\nsetting Sam up and then um you know and\nthen got to kind of you know the belief\nsystem how's the belief system set up in\nin in these foundational models in in in\nchat GPT right if it reads everything on\nthe internet uh you can see if you look\nat the YouTube comments that the sum\ntotal of humanity is actually quite\nbitter and you know argumentative and\nnegative and how does GPT train on all\nthe world and then kind of end up being\nso politically correct and and and so\nforth force and it got down to the point\nwhere it's like who inside OpenAI is\ndeciding you know what the belief system\nis of of GPT is it you I want names give\nme their names and titles and then of\ncourse um yeah moved moved on to the the\nthe copyright issue that's happening I I\ndidn't mention before but obviously all\nthe data in the world needs to be\nconsumed to get these models to the next\nlevel and anthropics just lost a $ 1.5\nbillion class action over um copyright\ninfringement because they scanned in\nhalf a million books without um paying\nthe authors and $3,000 of work. Uh it's\njust been ruled to pay 1.5 billion. So\nthere's a real compute cost there um\nthat that's added on top with the\ntraining data. But yeah, there was I\nthink it was a whistleblower inside\nOpenAI that was talking about um\npotential copyright infringement or what\nhave you from OpenAI. I don't know the\nfull details of that. Then um that\nwhistleblower ended up dead and um I\ndon't know if I probably should preempt\npeople watching Tucker's Tucker's\ninterview, but it was it was absolutely\nincredible the questioning that that\nkind of came out around that and asking\nSam what he thought of it. And I don't\nknow, I thought the average person in\nthe street if you kind of asked, you\nknow, did you kill someone? They would\ngo no. And then I and then don't be\nstupid, you're an idiot. Sort of a\nresponse, but way in which that was kind\nof I I think I think Sam was completely\nthrown by the question. But um yeah, it\nwas kind of interesting how the how the\nresponses came out.\n>> I thought that was amazing. And as an\ninterviewer, boy, I was just envious of\nCarlson because he nailed that. I guess\nwe should explain what was going on is\nhe was Carlson was asking Alman about a\nvery high-profile murder of one of\nOpenAI's employees. And Sam\n>> Well, suicide or suicide.\n>> Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Murder or suicide?\nCould it be either? Sam tried to take\nthe high road and show Tucker up and\nsay, \"Oh, Tucker, come on. We're we're\ntalking about the dead here. Don't you\nthink we should have a little more\nrespect for the subject matter?\" And he\nwas trying to be the holier than thou.\nYou know, I'm going to put you in your\nplace, Tucker, and make you look the bad\nguy. And Carlson just kept his composure\nso perfectly. And oh gosh, Sam, you\nknow, he would definitely be right. It\nwould be frankly very inappropriate for\nme to ask that question at anything less\nthan the behest of his mother who\nbelieves that you ordered his murder.\nSo, let's just skip to the chase. Sam,\ndid you did you kill him or didn't you?\nIt was something almost that direct. And\nI thought, wow, I don't even fantasize\nabout being that good at interviewing\nsomeday. On that note, let's uh let's\nend it there, Matt, because we are\nrunning out of time. Freelancer.com is\nan amazing platform. That is your day\njob. It is just a phenomenal to me. You\nyou pretty much upstage our entire\nepisode 500 countdown with something\nthat you do as a hobby. This is not even\nyour day job. What do you do for a\nliving in your day job? And how can\npeople learn more about how they can\noutsource a whole lot of cool stuff at\nfreelancer.com?\n>> Well, what whatever you need done, uh we\ncan do it for you at Freelancer, right?\nSo, we make it real. We turn your dreams\ninto reality. what you start want to\nstart a business, you want to grow your\nbusiness, you want to find people to\nbuild a product for you.

Give it a go and you'll see\nthe magic. and all the freelancers now\nAI powered and can get your job done,\nyour product built, your service\ndelivered uh at a fraction of the time,\nfraction of the cost.\n>> And I can definitely give a personal\nendorsement because I do use it\nregularly and I would say it's not\nreally a complaint but the only uh\nreally urgently needed repair at\nFreelancer is you got to filter out how\nmuch you can get at a low price because\nit's overwhelming to the point that you\ncan't just can't handle it. Don't pay\n300 bucks for a logo design. you will\nget three weeks of sorting through\ncontest entrance be before you're done.\nMatt, I can't thank you enough. We're\ngoing to wrap it there and Patrick Sesna\nand I will be back as Macrovoices\ncontinues right here at macrovoices.com.\n[Music]\nNow back to your hosts, Eric Townsend\nand Patrick Szna.\n>> Eric, it was great to have Matt back on\nthe show. Always a listener favorite.\nPatrick, we're getting great feedback on\nthe new trade of the week segment.\nWhat's on deck this week? Listeners,\nyou're going to find the download link\nfor the postgame trade of the week in\nyour research roundup email. If you\ndon't have a research roundup email,\nthat means you have not yet registered\nat macrovoices.com.\nJust go to our homepage,\nmacrovoices.com, and click on the red\nbutton over Matt's picture saying\nlooking for the downloads. Eric, let's\ngo a little deeper into the AI bubble\ntheme we just heard from Matt Barry.\nNow, Matt raised some serious concerns\nabout the sustainability of this AI\nboom. But what I've learned in almost 30\nyears of trading is that bubbles always\ngo farther and last longer than any\nrational person expects. Shorting the\nbubble before it pops is a widowmaker\ntrade. You can be absolutely right about\nthe endgame and still go broke along the\nway there. The time to press the short\nis after the airs already started coming\nout of the bubble. So the way I think\nabout it is this. As Soros famously\nsaid, when he sees a bubble, he buys it.\nIn the short term, the performance is\nchasing where the money is flowing. But\nbecause you know how it ends, you have\nto play it in a convex way with defined\nrisk instead of just sitting delta 1\nlong and fully exposed on the left tail.\nThat's the lesson from Stanley\nDenmiller, one of the smartest traders\nof our time, who openly tells the story\nof buying billions of dollars of tech\nstocks near the top of the dotcom bubble\nonly to lose $3 billion in six weeks\nwhen the music stopped. So, how do you\napply that lesson today? A good example\nis Nvidia. If you want to participate in\nthe AI run, but with defined risk,\ninstead of buying the stock outright,\nyou could structure a bull call spread.\nFor example, out to December 2026, you\ncould buy the 200 call for around $10\nand sell the $220 call for about $4.40.\nThat's a net debit of $5.60.\nWhat does this give you? A maximum\nupside of $20 between the strikes less\nthe $5.60 you paid. So about $14.40\npotential reward against $560\nof defined risk. In other words, almost\na 3:1 upside with no tail risk. That's\nexactly how you chase a bubble in a\nsmart way. Convex exposure, defined\ndownside, and plenty of participation if\nthe mania continues running. So, Eric,\nthat's exactly how you chase a bubble\nthe smart way. Convex exposure, defined\ndownside, and plenty of participation if\nthe media keeps running. If anyone wants\nto look at this deeper, the breakdown of\nthe trade is on page two of this week's\nchart deck. That explanation worked for\nthe pros and of course our retail\naudience can get the full briefing by\nattending Patrick's Monday webinar which\nalways dissects the trade of the week in\ndetail. Macrovoices listeners can get a\nfree trial at bigpicturetrading.com.\nPatrick, let's start with equities as\nper normal. What are the charts telling\nyou? So Eric, at the time of recording\nhere, the S&P 500 is trading at 6753.\nThe S&P futures closing exactly at\n6,800. We continue to close at fresh new\nhighs on this S&P as it relentlessly\ncontinues to climb. So, uh there is\nabsolutely nothing bearish to say\ntechnically on the trend. Old dips keep\ngetting bought, higher highs and higher\nlows. Uh everything is working in the\nfavor of the bulls. But Eric, when we\nlook at this from a quantitative\nperspective, this is not only the\nlongest rally in duration, but also the\nlargest in magnitude that we've had\nwithout a 5% correction this decade.\nThat's 100 percentile. At some point, we\nare going to just get a correction. It's\njust very natural that the market does\nthat and it's going to inevitably come.\nWhat are some of the things that are\nconcerning from that perspective? Well,\nnumber one, uh we are continuing to see\nthe breath of the market deteriorating.\nWe have only 55% of stocks trading above\ntheir 50-day moving averages in this\nenvironment. That's come off of a high\nof near 75 80% just a few months ago.\nYet, the market here continues to make\nnew highs. It's continues to show that\nthe market is relying more and more on a\nfewer and fewer number of stocks to keep\nthis going. Another example of that is\nlooking at the financials, the\nquintessential beta 1 asset. They have\nput in their highs back in August and we\nhave not been able to see the XLF uh\nfinancial ETF make a higher high and\nhold it since then. And so we've\ncontinued to see that this market is\nparticipating pretty much on this AI\nboom and the breath of the market is not\ncontributing. This in itself is showing\nthat there is uh a weakness under the\nhood and inevitably something will be a\ncatalyst that will spur on at least a\nsolid 300 S&P point correction in the 5%\nvariety. We'll see uh what the trigger\nfor that ultimately will come at.\n>> Patrick, let's hit the dollar index.\nPlenty to talk about there.\n>> Well, Eric, let's talk about that dollar\nbecause the dollar has broken to a\nhigher high. uh and we have now seen\nthat trade range that was established\nthroughout July, August, and September\nstarting to be broken to the upside.\nObviously, we had a brief little rip\nhigher in late July that still hasn't\nbeen able to be beaten. But overall,\nwe've seen the price action of dollar\nstrengthening. We're now four, five days\nabove its 50-day moving average. But\nit's not just the dollar index chart\nthat's interesting. It's about the fact\nthat the cross currencies are all\nbreaking. we see a euro break to a\nlittle bit of a lower low. Uh now\nconsolidating below its 50-day. The\npound sterling having had a failed rally\nhere uh last week that couldn't beat its\n50-day moving average and roll over. We\nhad those uh surprise election results\nin Japan that sent the yen sent lower\nwith the US dollar ripping to now almost\nsix month highs against the yen. We have\nthe US dollar against the CAD breaking\nout to multi-month highs. And so we're\nseeing that under the hood, we have a\nlot of these currencies where the US\ndollar is already strengthening. To me,\nthis is very interesting because\narguably so many of the asset classes\nfrom an intermarket perspective that\nhave worked so well this year were had\nthe tailwind of a weak dollar. If the US\ndollar here begins some counter trend\ntrade, maybe it's just a retracement,\nmaybe it's not a new US dollar bull\nmarket, but some sort of a retracement\nthat lasts several months and mean\nreverts a part of that loss. Uh the\nquestion is is that is that going to be\nthe catalyst that spurs profit taking in\nso many of these assets that have worked\nso well because of the dollar weakness?\nNonetheless, watching here whether this\nUS dollar breakout is for real. West\nTexas intermediate crude oil broke down\nto retest its May lows last week, but\nour good friend Dr. Anna Alhaji has a\nresearch note out saying the bearish\nnarrative probably isn't right. So, what\ncomes next in the charts, Patrick? Yeah,\nEric. Well, looking at crude oil,\ntechnically the price action is quite\ndistributive. Uh lower highs, lower\nlows. Now, while we have bounced this\nweek, we haven't been able to bounce\nback above the 50-day moving average,\nnor above its uh basic 50% retracement\nof the prior sell-off. So, you still\nhave to assume at this moment that this\nprice action is distributive. But\noverall, we have seen a fair value zone\nestablished throughout the summer in\nthis kind uh low60s area, and we haven't\nseen a technical legitimate breakdown\nout of it. And so in theory, this\nconsolidation could see the oil trade\nback to the top end of the range and\njust stay dominant in this new fair\nvalue zone. Uh in the end, there is no\ntechnical evidence that there's an\nimminent new bull breakout. That false\nstart few weeks ago kind of ended that\nuh very quickly, but I'm still looking\nat this very much from a neutral\nperspective. And Patrick, needless to\nsay, we've got to hit the gold chart\nthis week.\n>> Yeah, Eric, we do have to talk about\ngold. like what a rip this thing has\nhad. We've now cleared the 4,000 mark\nand are completing the measured move by\njust simply comparing the length of the\nfirst part of the rally that happened in\nthe first quarter of the year to the\nlength of this bull impulse. So now\nwe're in a situation where gold is\npretty much starting to exhaust itself.\nAnd what's interesting is that silver\nfinishing a measured move, platinum and\nplatium breaking out in this\nextraordinary way. We just have this\namazing bull run in all the entire\nprecious metals market. So, to me, this\nis balancing the long-term bullish\nperspective of precious metals because I\nthink that this has legs to continue in\nthe years to come, doing incredibly\nwell, and balancing that with short-term\ntactical strategies in terms of whether\nthis is the time to a accumulate more or\nwhether you need to wait for a pullback\nin order uh to reposition yourself on\nany precious metals positioning. As from\nmy perspective, I think at this stage\nthis there is very little asymmetry in\nstarting any new buying here on gold. At\nsome stage here, like we talked about\nlast week, there's a potential at any\npoint for a two even $300 pullback. That\nwould just be the new buying\nopportunity. I'm not in any way bearish,\nbut I think there's lots of opportunity\nnow to wait for pullbacks for new\ntactical entries. Patrick, I can't\nbelieve it, but because I've been\ntraveling all week, I'm actually out of\ntouch with the uranium market as well.\nWhat's going on in the charts?\n>> Well, Eric, let's talk about uranium. As\nas I've said in previous episodes, we\nhad a bare market that ended back in\nMarch and April from the looking at it\nfrom the commodity price. And we've seen\ngenerally positive price action over the\nlast six months. Higher highs, higher\nlows, above all its moving averages. Now\nthis week we finally got a brea a\nbreather a pullback and it's coming\nright to a 50% retracement coming right\nback to the levels where the highs were\nback in June and July. This is a very\ninteresting moment to see whether the\nbuy on dip traders show up right in this\nsweet spot because that is a typical\narea where you would see if it was\nbullish the dips starting to be bought\nhere. Wow Patrick we were talking about\nwhether or not copper was going to find\nsome some legs in its rally. big\nbreakout last Friday. Seems like the\nmarket's got the idea. What comes next?\n>> Well, Eric, on that copper chart, we\ndefinitely are seeing uh short-term\nbullish price action. Uh every dip is\nbeing bought, higher highs, getting\nabove key uh high volume consolidation\nlevels that were established earlier in\nthe year. It's very reasonable to assume\nthat we could be testing some of the\nhighs that were established in 2024 and\n25 up near the 5 and a/4 to 550 area\njust above. Patrick, before we wrap up\nthis week's show, let's hit that 10-year\nTreasury note chart.\n>> Finally, I wanted to just touch on that\n10-year Treasury yield. And we continue\nto see is that the yields continue to\nmake lower lows and lower highs,\ncontinue to reject a basic 50-day moving\naverage. So you still have a primary\ndowntrend in yields and a primary bull\nphase in bonds. We're going to continue\nto see whether that trend continues, but\nat this stage uh it's very plausible to\nhave downside targets near 360 to 380 on\nthe yields.
