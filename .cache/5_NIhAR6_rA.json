{"transcript": "welcome to this wealth Academy\neducational series I'm Adam coup and in\nthis lesson we'll be looking at how do\nyou profit by Trend following the index\nfirst a quick recap in my previous\nlessons I talked about how indices\nalways go up in the long term for\nexample if you look at the US indices\nlike the S&P 500 the NASDAQ and the Dow\nJones although they go through ups and\ndowns they're psychical in the short\nterm in the medium term but in the long\nterm they always go higher because of\npopulation growth and because of\ninflation so if you are a long-term\ninvestor it makes sense to Simply Buy\nand Hold the index for the long term\nusing ETFs or simply dollar cost\naveraging in fact if you look at the\nlast 30 years if you had held on to the\nDow Jones as a long-term investment\nyou'd have gotten a total of a 9 191%\nincrease in your\nCapital that amounts to a compounded\nannual growth rate of\n11.84% with dividends\nreinvested but if you look at it from a\nmedium-term perspective it tells a very\ndifferent story so if you look at it\nfrom a five-year perspective for example\nfrom 2006 to 2011 and that was a very\nvolatile period where we went through\nthe great financial crisis what if you\nemployed the Buy and Hold method at the\ntime you have gotten slaughtered or you\nwould have wasted your time for example\nin\n2006 the Dow Jones was at about 11,000\npoints and imagine if you bought the\nindex or you bought the ETF or you\nbought the blue\nchips and you held on to it and five\nyears later in\n2011 it was somewhere around 12,000\nwhich is very slight increase in fact\nit's more or less break even so you can\nsee that the Buy and Hold\nmethod only works for the very long term\nif you're willing to hold for 10 years\nor 15 years or longer but the medium\nterm which is 5 years or maybe three\nyears you cannot buy and whole because\nyou can buy and whole for five years and\nbreak even and you've wasted all your\ntime or imagine if you bought over here\nand you held it you know to here you\nknow in four years you would have been\ndown 5 to 10% if you bought over here\nand you held it you know three years\nlater you're down\n50% so if you want to make money\nconsistently in the short term and the\nmedium term you can't simply Buy and\nHold a stock on index you have to do\nTrend\nfollowing what does it mean if you look\nat any Market they move in Cycles or\nTrends so for example a market can go\nthrough a phase known as an uptrend\nphase where the market is optimistic it\nis bullish and the economy is growing so\non an uptrend prices tend to make higher\nhighs and higher lows that even though\nthe price goes\ndown it goes higher each time it goes\ndown at the same time markets would from\ntime to time reverse into a downtrend\nand downtrends can last for one to three\nyears so a downtrend happens when a\nmarket goes through a period of\nuncertainty crisis\nrecession so you can see this is a peri\nof a downtrend during the financial\ncrisis when prices still go up but every\ntime they go up they go much lower they\ngo up they go much lower they go up they\ngo much lower so the market makes lower\nhighs and lower\nlows if you want to make money\nconsistently in the short to medium term\nyou have to follow this important\nprinciple and the principle is this you\nonly invest with the Trend the trend is\nyour friend in other words you only buy\nwhen the market is on a clear\nuptrend and you never ever buy when a\nmarket is on a downtrend because on a\ndowntrend the statistical probability is\nthat prices will go lower and lower it's\nkind of like a river current you always\nwant to follow the current and not go\nagainst the\ncurrent so going back to that chart you\ncan see that the market over this period\nwent through an uptrend over here it\nwent through a downtrend and back into\nan uptrend again so if you simply invest\nwith the trend you would enter the\nmarket over here You' buy over here\nsomewhere over here at the beginning of\nthe uptrend so as it goes up you're\nprofiting from the market and the moment\nit reverses into a downtrend you have to\nexit at the beginning of the downtrend\nso as the market collapses you're not\ncaught you're not losing your profits\nand after everyone gets slaughtered in\nthe market you know and it reverses back\ninto an uptrend that's right you buy it\nback over here and you write the trend\nback up\nagain right so imagine if you were to\nbuy over\nhere and you sell over here and you get\nup before the crash and you bought back\nin over here and you sold somewhere here\nbought it back over here and held it to\nhere would you have made a lot more\nmoney of course You' have made a lot\nmore money than the person who held it\nover five years and barely broke even so\nthe question is why doesn't everyone do\nthis right well the reason is because\nmany people the majority of people in\nthe world including many of the\nprofessional fund managers and bankers\nthey've got no idea how to re Trends\nthey've got no idea you know when the\ntrend has changed or what the trend is\nnow now here's the good news there are a\nfew people who know this Secret and I'm\none of those people and that's how I've\nbeen making money consistently every\nsingle year for the last 15 years and\nthat's how my students make money from\nthis and in this video I'm going to\nteach you how you identify a change in\nTrend because the moment you can\nidentify the trend you can make a lot of\nmoney at the same time save your\nhardened money when the next downtrend\nhappens so how do you read Trends how do\nyou know when a trend has reversed well\nthere are many strategies which I teach\nso the simplest one I can give you right\nnow in a couple of minutes is using a\nmoving average crossover\ntechnique you can see from the chart\nover here I'm using the\n50 and the 150 day moving average which\nis the blue line and the green line now\nmoving averages are drawn by the\ncomputer charting software that you use\nso it's all mathematically calculated\nall you got to do is to input it into\nthe software and the software will\ngenerate these two lines for you so I'm\nnot going to go into the mathematics I'm\njust going to show you how it works\nhere's how it works listen carefully\nalways remember that on a\ndowntrend on a downtrend the 50-day\nmoving average which is the blue line is\nalways below the 150 day moving average\ngreen line so in other words when the\n150 green line is above the 50 blue line\nyou you never ever want to buy or be in\nthe market holding a stock because it's\na confirmed downtrend and probability\nthat prices will keep going lower and\nlower now here's a simple way to\nremember this imagine this is a 50\nkilogram man or skinny man right the\nblue one and the green is a 150 kg big\nman right so when a big man is sits on\ntop of the small man what happens that's\nright they go down they die all right so\nthat's how you can remember it at the\nsame time on a\ndowntrend always remember that both\nmoving averages are sloping\ndown the slope is really important so\nonce again on a\ndowntrend the 150 is above the 50 and\nboth moving averages are sloping\ndown so how do you know it's time to buy\nhow do you know it's a confirmed uptrend\nit has reversed Trend well there two\ncriterias to look at criteria number one\nis the two moving averages must stop\nsloping down in other words they must\nflatten and or slope up and both of them\nhave to be sloping up or\nflatten criteria number two the 50-day\nmoving average which is the blue line\nhas to cross above the 150-day moving\naverage green\nline so now the skinny man is on top the\nbig man is below the big man can carry\nthe skinny man and that's why they go up\nagain that's a simple way to remember\nthat clear enough okay now the reverse\nis\ntrue on an uptrend as you can see over\nhere on an uptrend the 50-day moving\naverage is above the 150 and both moving\naverages are that's right they're\nsloping\nup so if you're in the market and you're\nwriting the trend you write it all the\nway you stay invested\nbut you have to know when to get out\nwhen to exit so how do you know the\ntrend has reversed to a downtrend again\ntwo criterias criteria number one both\nmoving averages must have stopped\nsloping up they must be flat or sloping\ndown for example you can see over here\nit's\nflattening sloping down the blue is\nsloping down the green is flat criteria\nnumber two the 50 has to cross below the\n150 so the moment you see that cross\nover and neither are sloping up anymore\nyou sell you got to sell before the\ndowntrend commences and it's that\nsimple so let's go back again to our\nfiveyear chart so now you can see that\nby putting in the 50 and the 150-day\nmoving average it becomes very clear\nwhen to enter exit the markets so if you\ngo back to 2006 you can see the 50\nCrossing above the 150 and it they're\nboth SL sloping up so that is a an\nuptrend signal and that's when you buy\nright as you buy it's going up and\nyou're making money from that now over\nhere you see it goes through a a short\ncorrection correction you don't sell why\nbecause it's still an uptrend the 50 is\nabove the 150 it's merely what we call a\ndip on the uptrend in fact that's where\nyou buy more you always buy the dip on\nthe up tram so when you exit over here\nthe moment the 50 crosses below the 150\nyou can see the 50 is sloping down the\ngreen is flattening right over here\nthat's when you exit you have to sell so\nonce you sell what happens you get up\nbefore the market\ncrashes and you can see that many people\nwho do not understand this they may have\nbought over here they they'll think it's\ngoing up and they buy and the M it buy\nit goes back down it die right they say\nI'm going to you know it's going up they\nbuying it dies again it go up dies again\nso the market has a way of teasing you\nand killing you teasing you and killing\nyou so you do not want to buy at these\nfalse signals at the rallies on the\ndowntrend let everyone get killed and\nyou only enter over here when the 50\ncrosses back above the 150 you buy it\nover\nthere you can exit over there you buy it\nback over here and you hold it all the\nway there so notice that we are not\nattempting to predict where the market\nis going to go we are simply following\nthe trends if you do that you would\nenter over here and exit over there for\n22.7% return in slightly over a year and\na half you would enter here and exit\nover here for 31% return in 1 and a half\nyears and until over here to there it's\nabout 19% return in over 6 months that\nis a total of a\n72.7% return over four years\nthat's much better than holding for five\nyears and getting less than 2% return\nnow this works on any Market I'm from\nSingapore so let's look at a Singapore\nstock market this is Singapore straight\nstes index from 2007 to 2012 so the same\nthing happens if you were to buy the\nSingapore index over here back in\n2007 at 2,600\npoints and you held it all the way to\n2012 you would have broken even zero\nreturns you're wasting your time stupid\nright but if you use the 50 and the\n150-day moving average to look at the\ntrends you can make a lot more money so\nyou would have entered over\nthere when the 50 crossed the 150 you\nhave exited over here before the major\ncrash you clock a 40% return in a year\nand a half you would re-enter the market\nsomewhere over here when it crossed over\nyou enter it here you exit over here for\n39% return and that is a 79% return in\nthree years so this is a very powerful\nmethod to profit by Trend following and\nnotice again we are reading the\nmedium-term trends now no system no\ntechnique is perfect all right so what's\nthe disadvantage of this\nmethod the disadvantage is that it's a\nlagging indicator and it's a bit slow to\nreact so you can see for example the\nmarket topped over here at 3,900 points\nover here by the time the 50 crossed the\n150 over there and by the time you sold\nsomewhere here You' have sold it at\n3,200 points so you would have already\nmissed the first 20% or 25% down so it's\nslow to react similarly the market\nbottomed over here at 1470\nby the time the 50 crossed the 150 and\nyou bought in over here You' have bought\nin at\n2254 again it would have been very slow\nto react so this method doesn't get you\nin at the bottom it doesn't get you up\nat the top but it still makes you some\npretty decent profits of course if you\nwant to get in earlier and exit earlier\nyou have to use more Advanced Techniques\nwhich I teach in the wealth Academy\nprogram but for now I hope it you find\nthis useful and you can profit from this\nas an investor this Adam\ncoup your investment coach thank you for\nlistening and remember to subscribe
