{"transcript": "How to get whatever you want. That's the\ntitle of the next set of notes. How to\nget whatever you want. Here's what it\nsays. If you're ready, it\nsays,\n\"Ask.\" That's\nit. End of\nnotes.\nAsk. If there's one art in life to learn\nextremely well, that's got to be one of\nthem. The art of\nasking. What does ask mean? Ask means\nwhat do you\nwant? And the formula is staggering. It\nsays ask and\nwhat a guy ought to look into\nthat. See, you've got to be better than\na good worker. You've got to be a good\nasker. Now, let me give you three key\npoints on asking and receiving. This can\ndo it. Number\none, asking is the beginning of\nreceiving. Asking starts a unique\nprocess, mental and emotional. I don't\neven know how it works. All I know is it\nworks. It's like pushing a button and\nall this machinery starts working. I\ndon't know how. It just works. There's a\nlot of things you don't need to know\nhow. Just work them.\nSome people are always studying the\nroots. Others are picking the fruit. I\nmean, it depends on what end of it you\nwant in\non. Asking is the beginning of\nreceiving. So, start the process. Here's\nnumber two. Receiving is not the\nproblem. Receiving is\nautomatic. Now, if that's true,\nreceiving is not the problem. What's the\nproblem?\nFailure to ask might be one of your\nmajor problems. I don't know. Check it\nout. The guy says, \"Oh, now I see it. I\ngot up last year and hit it every day,\nbut there's not a scrap of paper with my\ngoals on\nit. Good\nworker. Poor asker.\" So, you got to\nchange that. Here's number\nthree. Receiving is like the ocean.\nThere's\nplenty. Success is not in short\nsupply. It isn't rationed and you\nstepped up to the window and it was all\ngone. No, no, no. It's like an ocean\nhere. Now, if that's true, what's the\nproblem? Well, some people go to the\nocean with a\nteaspoon. Have you got the picture?\nSee, what you want to do in view of the\nsize of the ocean is trade your teaspoon\nfor at least a\nbucket and you'll look better down at\nthe\nocean. Kids won't make fun of you,\nright? Okay. Now, there's two ways to\nask and we'll wrap up goal setting. Two\nways. Here's number one. Ask with\nintelligence.\nIt didn't say ask intelligently, but I'm\nsure it meant that. Don't mumble. You\ndon't get anything by\nmumbling. Be clear. Be specific.\nIntelligent asking means how wide, how\nhigh, how soon, when, what size, what\ncolor, how\nmuch. Define what you want and describe\nwhat you want. That's powerful. Goals\nbecome like a magnet. They pull you that\ndirection. And the better you describe\nthem, the more they\npull. So ask intelligently. Here's\nnumber two. Ask with\nfaith. That's the childish part of the\nequation. Believe you can get what you\nwant like a\nchild. Not an adult. Adults are too\nskeptical.\nSo the formula really reads, make plans\nlike an adult and believe in them like a\nchild and the most incredible things\nwill happen. Just try it for 90 days.\nJust try it. You can always go back to\nthe old ways. Just try it. Just 90 days.\n90 days.
