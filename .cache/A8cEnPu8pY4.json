{"transcript": "so I've taken quite a long break ever\nsince the Chinese lunar new year and\nit's been an effort to get started again\nto be quite honest been getting really\nreally lazy but I thought okay let's put\nout another video so in this video I'll\nbe talking about two favorite stocks of\nmany people uh two stocks I'm still\nholding uh one is paler and one is\nAlibaba so let's begin with paler as you\nguys know I first bought paler in early\n2023 at about $11 a share and uh I\nshared it on the YouTube on my YouTube\nchannel on the 12th of May 2023 and I\ntalked about at a time why I believe\npalente here would be a 10x stock now of\ncourse you remember what happened after\nthat after I bought it at $11 it dropped\nto $6 right so it's not always after you\nbuy a stock it goes up immediately there\nare times when after you buy a stock it\nmay drop you know 20 30 50% below your\npurchase price and there's nothing wrong\nwith that it's not that you made a\nmistake is simply that in the short term\nit is impossible to predict where the\nmarket is going because of of many\nmoving Parts all right so anyway so I\nheld on to the stock obviously because\nthe thesis did not change I believe that\nthe company would still um do really\nreally well and now one and a half years\nlater pener is has hit the 10x Target\nthat I set a year and a half ago all\nright so you can see my average price\nover there is uh\n$10.74 and uh this is of as of yesterday\nit hit a high of1 $24 so that is uh\n1,000% return uh that is over 10x and\npalen here is now the sixth largest\nposition in my entire portfolio now bear\nin mind for those of you who have been\nfollowing me especially those of you in\nmy community you would know that I've\nalready sold half my paler shares all\nright and if I didn't sell half my\nshares and I kept everything which I\nbought a year and a half ago palente\nhere would be my largest POS position so\nwhy did I sell half my shares and by the\nway I did sell a bit more yesterday just\nbefore the market closed and I was a bit\nlucky because I sold more yesterday at\n$123\n126 before the price dropped towards the\nend of the day because of news that Alex\nC the CEO was planning to sell I think I\nthink like 10 million shares um um in\nthe next year or so right now uh did I\nknow that that news was coming out of\ncourse not right so you know no one can\npredict the top of a stock and no one\ncan predict the bottom right we just\nfollow rules buy when it's undervalued\nsell when it's overvalued and that's all\nwe can do all right if you do that you\nwill make a lot of money and you don't\nhave to buy right at the bottom you\ndon't have to buy right right at the top\nno one can do that I can do that so\ndon't always think that you can pick top\nand bottoms it it is impossible right so\na lot of people ask this question uh you\nknow Adam if I'm holding palent here\nshould I sell my shares and how much\nshould I sell and that's a very good\nquestion I've been getting and I thought\nthat I would really address it right\nhere and right now so remember that as\nan\ninvestor when do you want to sell shares\nof an investment remember when you\ninvest in a company you're taking a\nlong-term View and to me as long as the\nbusiness that you own the shares of the\nbusiness you own continues to grow it's\ngot a long\nRunway you let it you hold on to it and\nlet it compound okay so don't sell a\nshare just because it's gone up 10x or\nit's gone up 20x it doesn't matter how\nmuch it's gone up right to me you only\nsell shares of a company if either the\nbusiness is losing its competitive\nAdvantage where the growth is not as\ngreat anymore and you can reinvest into\na stronger company or the company is\nstill great but the share price is way\novervalued all right so those are the\nonly reasons you should sell shares of a\ngreat company now in the case of paler\nwhy have I sold half my\nshares the company is still great the\ncompany is growing like\ncrazy I sold half my shares because it\nis way overvalued all right uh so what's\nwhat's my intrinsic value it's currently\nat $36 a share that's right that's the\nintrinsic value so at $112 it is way way\novervalued by the way if you're\nwondering yeah stock Oracle will soon\nsoon be available we're going to launch\nit to the public somewhere in late March\nright supposed to be January but because\nthere were many changes I wanted to add\nnew features in so late March you can\nget access to stock Oracle and once you\nlog in immediately you can see uh the\nstrength of the economic mode as well as\nthe uh intrinsic value over here which\nagain palente here the intrinsic value\nis excuse me uh $36\nso again it's way over Valu and that's\nthe reason why I've sold half my\nposition so some of you may be wondering\nad if it's overvalued why why don't you\nsell all your position when you sell\n100% I was thinking about that but the\nreason why I'm still holding to half my\nposition is because I I believe that in\nthe long run uh palente here could\nbecome the next\nSalesforce uh of the AI world or even\nthe next Microsoft of the AI world so as\nyou know Salesforce is the default\nleader in customer relationship\nmanagement when it comes to PCS the\ndefault operating system is Windows when\nit comes to Apple the default operating\nsystem is IOS so in the AI world if you\nlook at what palena is doing their\nmodels which is Foundry and Gotham could\neventually become the default operating\nsystem for Global Enterprises running AI\nnow is it a guarantee of course not but\nI think that is a possibility because of\ntheir unique uh software offering and if\nthat happens could palente here still\ndouble and triple from here yes of\ncourse there's no guarantee it depends\non how they execute right so the whole\npoint is this at this point of time\npaler is a narrow mode company and right\nnow in the short term it is way\novervalued all right but in the longer\nterm they could become a white mode\ncompany possibly\nuh and their earnings if if their\nearnings and cash flow continue to grow\nsignificantly like what happened to\nNvidia then they could grow into their\nvaluation again there's no guarantees\nand that's why it's prudent uh that\nright now because it's short-term\novervalued to scale down your position\nso again when I get questions from\npeople should I sell palent here it\nreally depends on your current\nallocation to your portfolio so for\nexample in portfolio you should have a\ndiversified group of companies and in my\nopinion uh each stock should not take up\nmore than 10% allocation in your\nportfolio so more than 10% it's is\ngetting a bit risky right so for example\nif right now uh so I a student for\nexample he said Adam my entire portfolio\nhas one stock called palente here 100%\ninto palente here and I told him that if\nI were you I would definitely sell paler\nall right I sell palen here from 100%\nallocation sell it down to let's say 20%\nor more comfortably 10% you get what I'm\nsaying because it's overallocated right\nbut if pener currently was only\num say it was only 3% of your portfolio\nthen you may you may not want to sell it\neven though it's short-term overvalued\nbecause in the long run it could again\nuh be what the strongest players in AI\nso it all depends on your allocation so\nfor me when I first bought palente here\none and a half years ago it was a was it\nwas was a speculative stock so being a\nspeculative company I usually allocate\nonly 1% of my portfolio to the stock so\n1% it went up 10 fold right so 1%\nbecomes 10% so like I said if I had not\nsold a single share today paler would\nmake up 10% of my portfolio now because\nI've sold more than half the position uh\npalenia now makes up just about 4% of\nthe entire portfolio uh position so\nagain to to summarize the reason I sold\npalent here is not because it went up\n10x no it's not because it's got a big\nallocation no it's simply because it is\nway\novervalued um it is kind of like almost\nthree times above the intrinsic value\nnow hypothetically hypothetically if\npenus intrinsic value was say $100 right\nnow and at 112 it is only slightly\novervalued would I sell paler no I\nwouldn't sell a single share so even if\npaler went up 10 times I wouldn't sell\nit if it was near the intrinsic value so\nultimately it is all about the intrinsic\nvalue that's the most important thing so\ngive you another example if you look at\nAmazon um Amazon has also gone up a lot\nin my portfolio and now Amazon is the\nbig position in my portfolio the biggest\nposition but I've not sold a single\nshare of Amazon not a single share why\nbecause Amazon is not very overvalued uh\nwhat's the intrinsic value let me just\nshow\nyou\num all right so we can see that for\nAmazon which is a white mode company the\nintrinsic value is\n$221 and the current share price is $226\nwhich is just slightly overpriced so\nthese are the kind of stocks that I\nwon't sell so let me now talk about the\nother favorite stock of many people\nwhich is alib Baba now if you recall\nabout a year ago I created this YouTube\nvideo which is China stocks I'm done\nokay and the trouble with a lot of\npeople is that they don't watch my\nentire video they just look at the title\nand they assume that I sold all my\nchannel stocks I have not all right so\nif you watch the video you know that\nwhat I said at that point of time was\nthat I'm done with China stocks meaning\nI'm not going to buy any more China\nStocks by not selling my China stocks\nwhich I already own I've been holding\nChina stocks for many many years there's\nonly one China stock I sold which was 10\ncent all right that's the only one but\nI'm still holding Alibaba I'm holding JD\nI'm holding the China Tech ETF I'm\nholding the Hing index ETF I'm holding\nping un insurance I'm holding a lot of\nChina companies still in my portfolio\nright which I've been holding now for\nmany many years so have I changed my\nmind on this no I've not changed my mind\nthis is still true I'm done meaning I'm\nnot buying any more China stocks okay\nbut I'm still holding what I bought in\nthe past why because it didn't make\nsense to sell in the last few years when\nit was so undervalued all right to me as\nlong as a company is still making money\nit is still growing it doesn't make\nsense to sell it when it's so over so\nit's so under value it doesn't make\nsense right because if you know it's a\ngood company and it's still grow going\nultimately it will get to its intrinsic\nvalue and that's the time to sell it at\nthe intrinsic value or above the\nintrinsic value all right and the reason\nwhy I'm not going to hold China stocks\nfor the long run which I already said\nI'm going to sell it when I get a good\nprice is because in the long run I don't\nfind China companies as certain as\npredictable as us companies simply\nbecause of the government there they can\noverreach and they can uh change the\nbusiness models of companies that they\ndon't like and that is something which\nI'm not comfortable with has that\nchanged no I'm still of that mindset\nokay so nothing has changed just to let\nyou know so uh there are some\ninteresting developments let me talk\nabout that the first development is that\nuh president shei uh recently he gave a\nspeech and he met up with a lot of the\nChina Tech leaders he met up with JMA\nAlibaba and all the China Tech leaders\nand I think he was sending a message\nthat you know what I you know I bashed\nup these guys you know we regulated them\nbut now we are friends again I'm going\nto we're going to support the tech\ncompanies that they got to make money\nall right and as you guys recall a few\nyears ago the\npolicy of the Chinese CCP was common\nProsperity so in I what it was saying at\na point of time that scared investors\nwas that uh we didn't like people to be\nrich that's the message that people got\nwe don't like people to be rich uh we\nwant you to share the prosperity and\npeople who were Rich they were targeted\nand companies that were too powerful\nthey were targeted and because of that a\nlot of investors foreign investors ran\naway including many people I\nknew and then I guess they realize that\nwithout the entrepreneurial ambition of\npeople wanting to become rich and grow\nin their companies the whole country\ncouldn't Prosper you know if you don't\nhave a Fu that becomes rich you can't\nhave the rest become rich you need these\nentrepreneurs you need these Risk Takers\nyou need people who are driven by by\nprofit all right that's human nature so\nin the recent speech this is what he\nsaid I can't read mandrin I filled my\nmandin in school so Google translate\nsaid have the ambition to serve the\ncountry be dedicated to development\nabide by the law operate well and\npromote common Prosperity by getting\nrich first so now they're saying that\nokay for the entrepreneurs it's okay to\nget\nrich then you help the other people so\nit's it's a big Str structural change in\ntheir policy and uh so that has really\nshifted the sentiment and given\ninvestors a lot more confidence at the\nsame time as you guys know the the news\nwith deep seek shows that China is\nactually a lot further ahead in AI than\nwhat the Western will give them credit\nfor although I doubt very much that deep\nseek spend so little to achieve that I\nthink they spend a lot more all right\nbut anyway the fact is that they've\ndeveloped AI uh to a level which is\ncomparable to the west or even maybe um\novertaken the West in certain areas\nright now specific to Alibaba which is\nmy biggest position in terms of China\nstocks which I'm still holding for for\nmany many years uh some interesting news\nnumber one uh Alibaba has now or rather\nApple has teamed up with Alibaba to\nprovide AI on the Apple iPhones in China\nso Alibaba is the main provider of AI to\nApple iPhones so it was a great\ndevelopment and uh there was some news\nthat alib Baba is also looking to buy\ndeep sea but I think that has\nbeen um discounted right what is\ninteresting is Alibaba just announced\ntheir earnings a few hours ago and they\nhad blowout earnings so their revenue\nincreased 8% year on-ear way above\nexpectations their net income increased\n333 way above expectations Cloud Revenue\ngrew double dig double which is\n133% so it was a great earnings report\nand now before the market open Alibaba\nis up\n10% uh pre-market which would bring the\nshare price to\n$139 okay so what are my thoughts am I\ngoing to sell Alibaba very soon a lot of\npeople are asking me that question or am\nI going to hold on for a bit longer okay\nso again the question is all about all\nabout all about intrinsic value that's\nright what's the current intrinsic value\nof Alibaba it is on stock Oracle\n$137 so the closing share price\nyesterday before the earnings report was\n$125 so as of yesterday alib Baba uh was\nstill undervalued all right so the\nreason why I didn't sell Alibaba over\nthe last four years is because it\ndoesn't make sense to sell a company\nwhen it's so undervalued if the company\nis making money all right but now it\nlooks like uh it may get above the\nintrinsic value today okay but bear in\nmind that this intrinsic value\n137 is based on the last earnings report\nso now that they reported new earnings\nwith new cash flow we will do a\nrevaluation in the next few days so\ntheir intrinsic value may increase may\nincrease we'll see how it goes right so\nuh based on the new intrinsic value I\nwould I would then decide where to sell\nthe shares and I want to sell it\nobviously above the intrinsic value uh\nin fact I like to ideally sell it at\nleast 20 to 30% above the intrinsic\nvalue so that I feel that I'm getting a\ngood deal all right some people asked me\na few weeks ago they say you know\nAlibaba is now coming back why don't you\nyou know sell it you've been waiting so\nlong to sell it just get rid of it and\nand break even and to me that doesn't\nmake sense after I hold it for 4 and a\nhalf years you want me to just sell at\nbreak even are you insane okay I want to\nat least make some money after you know\nholding for four and a half years it's\nlike you you you date a girl wanting to\nhave a good time with the girl and the\nmoment you date her she went into a coma\nfor four and a half years and you stayed\nby her side every day looking at her in\na coma and now that she's woken out of\nthe coma why would you want to dumb her\nand and right and and waste 4 and a half\nyears now that she's out of the coma at\nleast go with her a few times you know\nhave fun and enjoy yourself and once you\nhave at least gotten something out of\nthe relationship\nthen you can dumb her for another girl\nokay sounds horrible but it's just a fun\nanalogy chill chill don't get offended\npeople get offended so easily nowadays\nso if you take a look at the charts\nthere you see you can see the current\nintrinsic value which again may be uh\nrevised up in the next few days once we\ndo a revaluation but assuming that the\nintrinsic value remains at 137 then\nagain I would like to sell Alibaba uh\nwhen it gets you know maybe 20 30% above\nthe intrinsic value maybe I could Target\nselling at you know 200 or you know 2\n250 somewhere around there all right\nwe'll see how it goes so it's going to\nbe a discretionary exit based on the\nprice action so once I see that oh there\ncould be a potential top then I may\nscale out and as always I never sell all\nat once because you can never tell the\ntop right you want to sell in stages and\nfor the rest of my positions again I'm\nholding some JD I'm holding the hansing\ntech ETF I'm holding some China ETFs I'm\nnot going to sell so early I'm going to\nhold for a while because I believe that\nuh this China bull market could last a\ncouple of years uh like I said I'm not\ngoing to hold it for the long term\nbecause the government the CCP could\nchange their mind anytime and that\nthat's very uncertain but I think they\nwould not change uh and and screw people\nup at least in the next one two years so\nI think that this bull market does have\nat least a one 2 threee window\nuh to run and make some good profits out\nof it especially those of us who have\nbeen like holding the bag for the last\nuh four years Make It Count get\nsomething out of it okay so hope this\nhas been useful and as always May the\nmarus be with you and I'll see you guys\nin the next video if you want to catch\nmy latest videos click on
