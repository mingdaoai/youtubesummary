{"transcript": "so Wall Street is in panic mode once\nagain the NASDAQ futures before the\nMarket opens is down 3% we've got\nsemiconductor stocks like Nvidia asml\ndown 7 to 9% we've got big tech\ncompanies like Microsoft uh meta down 3\n4 5% why because of news that China's\nnew deep seek AI model has overtaken all\nthe US models at a fraction of the cost\nso what's the implication to us big tag\nand what should we do about it let me\nbreak it down in this video\n[Music]\nso this news started 3 weeks ago in late\nDecember when a Chinese AI company\ncalled Deep seek they said that hey we\ndeveloped a uh new open- source large\nlanguage model or those AI chatbots that\nis better than chat GPT better than\nGoogle B and you know what you guys\nspend billions of dollars to create your\nlarge language models like for example\nGoogle spends like uh 31 billion a year\nin capex um open AI Che GPT they spend\nabout 5 billion a year uh anthropic\nanthropics clot spends like a billion a\nyear and you know what we did everything\nbetter than you guys at $5.6 million\nright a fraction of the cost and and the\nmost surprising thing was that based on\na third- party comparison their deep\nseek model outperform matters Lama 3.1\nopen AI gp4 uh anthropics clot Sonet 3.5\nin accuracy ranging from complex problem\nsolving to math and coding which you can\nsee from this chart over here again deep\nseed outperforming all of the US uh\nlarge language models and the best part\nis that deep 68 you know what we did it\nwith the lowend Nvidia chips so as you\nguys know uh the US government has bed\nNvidia from selling their high-end chips\nto China High their latest high-end\nchips are the h100s so China can only\nget the lower-end chips that are half as\npowerful called the H 800s so deeps is\nsaying you know what we use the lousiest\nNvidia chips uh at only $5.6 million and\nin two months we managed to outperform\nall your large language models that cost\nbillions and billions of dollars with\nthe latest Nvidia chips so this has\ncaused many US tech companies to freak\nout because it's like how can you now\njustify you're spending billions and\nbillions on Nvidia chips on all the\nlatest technology when the Chinese\ncompany is spending only $5 million and\nthey can overtake all of you so it's\nkind of like the US tech companies like\nmeta like open AI like Microsoft\nspending millions of dollars buying a\nMcLaren car whereas the the Chinese\ndriver spends $30,000 on a Toyota and in\nthe race track the Toyota is able to go\nfaster than McLaren this is causing a\nlot of panic on Wall Street because\nthere are few implications number one if\nthis is really really true that means\nthat now China is providing opsource\nfree uh large language models to the\nrest of the world why would people pay\nmoney to use open AI Strat GPT why would\npeople pay money to use uh Google's uh\nAdvanced Gemini systems they can get it\nfree from China right so that's one\nconcern the second concern would be okay\nif this is true then all your\nhyperscalers like Amazon and Google and\nmeta spending billions of dollars on AMD\non Nvidia chips maybe they don't need to\nmaybe they can spend uh 80% less and buy\nthe the lowest end chip chips or you\nknow buy less chips and get the same\nperformance so that's causing people to\nfreak out and again Nvidia is crashing\nAMD is crashing all these stocks all\ncrashing so how concerned should we be\nso the first thing as an investor is\nDon't Panic okay look at the facts and\nthink rationally the first question to\nask is are these claims true How likely\nis it that a Chinese company could again\nspend only $5.6 million and use the\nlower lower end Nvidia chips and\novertake the US tech companies that are\nspending billions of dollars by the way\nGoogle spends 50 billion a year I\nmisspoke I said 30 billion Google\nspending 50 billion year in cacks using\nthe most advanced nvida chips so How\nlikely is that Chinese company in other\nwords How likely is a Toyota able to\noutperform a\nMcLaren that's the question and honestly\nI'm not sure uh but I got to be a bit\nskeptical and and question how true this\nis so what's interesting is that there\nwas this article that came out and they\ninterviewed another Chinese uh AI\nCompany CEO and this is what he said so\nso this guy his name is Alexander Wang I\nthink it's Wang or Wang right and he\nsaid this he said according to Wang when\nit comes to Chinese accessing nvidia's\nmost advanced\ngpus are they really accessing it yes or\nno and he said you know the Chinese labs\nthey have more\nh100s than what people think so he's\nkind of like uh letting the cat out of\nthe B right and he added and he shared\nthat his understanding is that deep seek\nhas about 50,000 h100 Nvidia chips now\nwhy isn't deep seek U admitting to this\nfor a very simple reason if they did\nthey'll be in deep okay because\nremember that in 2022 the Biden\nAdministration baned Nvidia from selling\ntheir Superior chips to China so the\nh100s are not allowed to be sold to\nChina so Nvidia had to espcially develop\na lower-end chip the h800 and a800 which\ncan be sold to China so again deeps is\nclaiming they're using the h800 which\nare the lower end which by by the way uh\nare now banned as well so the US has now\nbanned all these things right no no soup\nfor you no h100 no h 800 right and they\nban it in October of 2023 so what this\nguy Wang is saying is that um you know\nChina and this company they can't admit\nthey've got h100 if they did Nvidia uh\nmay be in trouble for maybe Sly selling\nit to them or sometimes it's not envidia\nfault sometimes uh there are companies\nin other countries where they set up\nshell companies in other countries that\nare not exposed to the export band so\nthey buy the chips from Nvidia and then\nthey resell it to China so China is\ngetting it um through a loophole right\nand of course they can't admit it if\nthey admit it then that middleman compan\nis going to get in big all right so\nthey're going to say no we don't the\nh100s we have the H 800s okay so that's\nwhat Wang is saying he said they can't\ntalk about it obviously because it is\nagainst the export controls that the US\nhas put in place and he also thinks that\nthey have more chips than what other\npeople expect that they have so if what\nthis guy Wang says is true then deep\nseek actually has got 50,000 I'm not\nsure why he's so specific but he claims\nthat deep seek has 50,000 h100 gpus now\nif that is true then if you take the\naverage cost of one h100 GPU and you\nmultiply it basically deep seek uh\nactually spent between 1.25 billion to\n1.75 billion just on and Via chips which\nis not too far away from what anthropics\nspent in the US am I saying that deep\nseek is bullshitting everyone in order\nto create panic in the uh us\nmarkets I don't know right it's a\npossibility it's a theory but I'm not\n100% sure obviously because I don't know\nokay but let's give the Chinese the\nbenefit of the doubt let's say it is\ntrue that they didn't use the h100s that\nthey're using the H 800s could they have\npulled it off well it's possible as well\nso one possibility is that instead of\ndeveloping their own proprietary AI\nmodels using the most advanced chips\ndeep seek basically uh relied on widely\navailable open- Source technology which\nis available from open AI already and\niterating on existing technology\ntweaking available data sets and\nleveraging on existing models so in\nother words basically deep seek they\nkind of like copied the output of cck GP\nall right to to to create their llm\nsystems Okay now what's interesting is\nthat a couple of days ago if you locked\ninto deep seek and you type this\nquestion what model are you guess what\nanswer they gave this is from Deep seek\nby the way they said I'm an AI language\nmodel called cat GPT developed by open\nAI specifically I'm based on the GPT for\narchitecture holy okay so deeps\ndoes doesn't even believe that they\ndeeps right deep seek has got an\nidentity crisis deep seek think that\nthinks that it's check GPT so it sounds\nlike they're kind of like copying\nwholesale check GPT by\nsomehow uh replicating uh cck gpts out I\ndon't know how the hell it happens right\nI'm not a tech engineer I'm not a techy\nguy uh sounds like someone I know right\nyou know called e CB right except the\ndifference is that deeps is supposed to\nbe Superior to what they C it but that\nCB is totally inferior okay that's the\nonly difference so anyway once again\nlet's give the benefit of the doubt\nlet's assume that the Chinese company\nreally uses the lower end chips they\nonly spend $5 million and they can\nreplicate this and they and they can\nscale this let's say okay and by the way\nthat the other thing that's freaking out\nthe market is now deep sea is number one\non the on the Apple App Store and they\nsay oh everyone's going to deep sea no\none's going to use CH GPT anymore deeps\nis going to take over so what are the\nimplications first let's look at the\nimplications for uh deeps direct\ncompetitors which would be companies\nthat have developed their own large\nlanguage models which is basically open\nAI anthropic matters Ai and of course\nalphabet Google's\nGemini so I always believe that in\nanything there's always the negatives\nand the positives so let's begin with\nthe negatives so if this is true and\ndeep SE now offers a free open-source\nlarge language model that is superior to\ncat GPT and Gemini what's going to\nhappen right so the first thing that\ncould happen would be this could def\ndefinitely lower the revenue of these\ncompanies if they are forced to lower\nthe prices for their uh llm\nsubscriptions their large language model\nsubscriptions when you subscribe to\nGemini advance or check GPT 4 you pay\nmoney to exess but why would you do it\nwhen you can get it for free with deep\nsea right so they could be forced to\nlower their prices for API access their\nEnterprise Solutions or Cloud Computing\nServices that leverage\nAI now among all these companies which\nwould be the most impacted uh the most\nimpacted would obviously be open Ai and\nanthropic why because the entire\nbusiness model their main Revenue comes\nfrom subscription of its AI large\nlanguage model so they'll be the biggest\nto be hit right now as far as meta and\nGoogle are concerned which are the\nstocks I own I think it could be more\npositive than negative the first reason\nit could be positive is because again\nmeta is projected to spend over $60\nbillion in capex in developing their AI\nmodels uh in 2025 and Google is\nprojected to spend uh $50 billion now\nimagine if it is true that deep sea can\nachieve so much with a fraction of the\ncost then isn't it good news that means\nthat meta could potentially not spend 60\nbillion meta could spend maybe $6\nmillion right if what deep 6 says is\ntrue Google instead of spending 50\nbillion may spend $5 million so if if\nmeta could save 60 billion and Google\ncould could save 50 billion achieving\nwhat they want to achieve uh in AI then\nthat would lead to huge cost savings\nhuge capex savings and increase their\nprofit margins increase their earnings\nper share and be great for the share\nprice second reason I'm not too\nconcerned about Google and meta\nspecifically is because their main\nbusiness model their main Revenue\ngenerator is Not subscription from their\nlarge language models so for examp\nexample Google does um charge a\nsubscription for their Advanced gini but\nagain it is very NE negligible the the\nrevenue that they get right as far as\nGoogle is concerned where do they make\nmost of their money from advertising\nright advertising advertising is their\nmain Revenue generator and by the way\nGoogle also owns way more which is the\nmarket leader in autonomous driving\nsoftware which is going to be another\nhuge uh source of income and of course\nGoogle owns YouTube which is another big\nsource of uh Revenue meta same thing\nmeta primarily makes their money through\nadvertising not through AI subscriptions\nper se so these two companies Google and\nmeta they primarily monetize AI through\nadvertising through better user\ntargeting recommendation engines and at\nplatforms but of course we can think\nlogically and rationally but the market\ntends to react to this news Market in\nthe short term tends to overreact to bad\nnews and over overreact to good news so\nas an investor once we know that we've\ngot a high quality company that we want\nto buy we know the intrinsic value we\nuse these short-term panics and fears to\nadd shares if we don't already have a\nfull position so as I'm speaking right\nnow before the Market opens you can see\nthat NASDAQ is already down\n3.44% in terms of the Futures right you\ncan see big drop right here well not\nreally that big but it's a significant\nuh pullback because of this news now if\nwe look at for example uh\nGoogle or alphabet all right so you can\nsee that's a chart right here now if we\nlook at the uh pre-market data so\npre-market it's down all the way to 193\nso it's down I think about what 4\n5% uh if the Market opens there 193 is\nthat 193 yeah 193 so so that would be\nsomewhere about there so Google uh could\nopen all the way down here dropping from\nthe previous day now again if you look\nat it from a grand from the grand scheme\nof things is it a is it a big drop well\nnot yet right so again it's all about\nintrinsic value my intrinsic value for\nGoogle is\n$26 so with that drop to13 yeah it's\nundervalued but it's not undervalued\nenough all right so as a as an investor\nI like to buy great companies when\nthere's a bigger margin of safety when\nthe share price is much lower below the\nintrinsic value so that I get a discount\nright and what I do every month is that\nI will update my buy levels for each\nstock so for Google for example my buy\nlevels where I would add more shares if\nI didn't have a full position would be\nat\n177 167 154 and 147 these are my four\nbuy levels determined by Tech technical\nsupport levels on a daily weekly and\nmonthly time frame so in other words for\nme to get interested to add more Google\nuh it's going to drop a lot more all\nright it's going to drop to now I\nalready have a lot of Google personally\nright so for me I'll only be tempted to\nbuy uh only if it gets to like 154 147\nand maybe I'll be tempted to buy right\nbut right now it's not that big of a\ndiscount to get me excited just yet how\nabout meta I also have a pretty big\nposition in meta which I bought at much\nlower levels um and meta by way is now\novervalued okay my intrinsic value for\nmeta is\n$549 so right now it's\n$652 but uh based on the pre-market data\nlet's see it's down to 620 based on the\npre-market\ndata so if it opens at 620 let's see\nwhere does that bring us if it opens at\n620 be somewhere there still not cheap\nenough right just a drop there no big\ndeal right so again it's still\noverpriced right you know for meta for\nme to want to add more meta is going to\ngo below my 549 intrinsic value where\nit's going to drop a lot lower come on\nyou can do better than that right so my\nbuy levels for meta are 541 496 453 and\n414 uh and the reason I always have you\nknow three to four buy levels is because\nwe never buy at once we always average\nin our position yeah and again I already\nhave a big position in matter so I'll\nonly be tempted to buy only at the third\nor fourth buy level but if I did not own\nany meta shares at all and I I was\nbuilding a new position then I would\nstart adding uh at the first support\nlevel I will start you know nibbling a\nbit at 541 and then buying more at 496\nor lower so let's take a look at now the\nimplications and the impact on\nsemiconductor stocks specifically Nvidia\nwhich now uh designs the bulk of the\nhigh-end Advanced accelerators the the\nadvanced Ai gpus and of course the\nrelated semiconductor\nuh companies like asml or TSM or broad\ncomment how does it affect if deep seeks\nclaims are true now if deep six claims\nare true that you can do more with a lot\nless chips then could their demand for\nadvanced Nvidia chips be affected yes\nthere could be a short-term demand hit\nnow how much demand hit is very hard to\nspeculate it's very hard to quantify\ncould it be uh 10 20 30 50% drop in\norders I don't know it's really hard to\nspeculate right so like I said if deep 6\nmodel truly requires fewer specialized\nAI chips to achieve Superior performance\nthe major C providers again your Amazon\nmeta Microsoft may cut down on their\npurchase of the high-end Nvidia chips or\nmay slow down the orders of the AI\naccelerators and could that hit the\nshare price in the short term absolutely\nbut again by how much is very hard\nquantify so at this point of time am I\ngoing to uh change reduce the intrinsic\nvalue of my semiconductor stocks not yet\nbecause again it's very speculative at\nthis moment again I don't know whether\nthe claims are true and if they are true\ndoes it mean that the hyperscalers will\ncut all their orders and not buy Nvidia\nchips anymore which they've ordered\nagain we don't know right it's hard to\nquantify so for now what's my game plan\nmy game plan is to hold my Nvidia shares\nI've got about a 4% allocation in my\nportfolio I'm going to hold the shares\nI'm going to I'm not going to panic and\nsell my Nvidia or ASM I just going to\nhold it right but when it comes to\nadding more shares again as always I\nnever buy and sell based on speculation\nof prediction I look at the intrinsic\nvalue and I only buy if the price goes\nbelow the intrinsic value byy a certain\ndiscount so I've got a margin of safety\nso I'm going to maintain my valuation\nbut give myself a bigger margin of\nsafety let's take a look at where Nvidia\nis right now in terms of the charts and\nthe intrinsic value again the market has\nnot opened yet so I can only look at\npre-market data when the Market opens\nthe price could be a lot lower or higher\nI don't know right so Nvidia currently\nmy valuation based on the current free\ncash flow and their current projections\nuh is about\n$130 and um Market Clos at 142 on Friday\nuh last week so based on the pre-market\ndata I I think Nvidia is down like 9 %\nright now let me just double check okay\njust go to trade here and yep so the\nopening bid and R is about 128 129 which\nthink about 9% drop right so where does\nthat land on the chart so that would\nland at 128 right that would land\nsomewhere uh here right 128 let me just\ndouble check that again by looking at\nthe pre-market\ndata uh y 12 8 is the pre-market data\nokay so if it opens at let's see\n128 uh that would be below my intrinsic\nvalue of 130 but again would it be cheap\nenough for me to add more shares no\nbecause I don't really have a margin of\nsafety because what if their orders get\nslowed down because the hyperscalers cut\ntheir orders then the valuation May\nreadjust downwards okay so as you can\nsee as always I've got my four buy\nlevels at one 2111 $90\n$75 and uh again it's not even at my\nfirst buy level 128 it's not even in my\nfirst buy level okay and if I didn't\nhave any Nvidia shares at 121 I may\nnibble a bit right but for me I already\nhave a 4% position so I probably only\nwant to buy uh below a 100 below $100 it\ngives me at least a bit of a margin of\nsafety okay so how about other companies\nlike say asml\nso asml already got hit actually right\nbecause of the cyclical\nslowdown uh in\ntheir their orders from Samsung and and\nand TSM uh so theyve they've dropped\nquite a bit but they've kind of like\nrebounded and now with this band new is\ngoing to drop again and pre-market data\nputs it at\n651 so that's I think what 12% drop 651\nso that would bring it to somewhere here\nwell almost back down to the previous\nlows right back down to previous lows so\nmy valuation for asml is$ 797 I'm not\nchanging the valuation and that would\nactually bring it down near near the uh\nfourth support level which would\nactually be pretty attractive for asml\naren't I concerned that if deep SE\nclaims happen to be true wouldn't that\nreally affect uh the business of the\nsemiconductor stocks and if so why am I\nholding why am I not selling it away\nwell because again I'm a long-term\ninvestor when it comes to these stocks\nI'm investing for the for the very long\nrun and while there could be I again I\nuse the word could be right well there\ncould be a short-term demand hit if the\nclaims are true but I believe that\nlong-term the demand will grow the\ndemand will make up for it okay over\ntime why because as large language\nmodels become more cost\neffective uh based on deep claims uh\nsorry deep seeks claims then there could\nbe a wider adoption of AI across\nindustries that previously found it too\nexpensive so right now it's only the\nvery rich companies the hyperscalers The\nMeta the Google the Amazon that can\nafford uh to build their own proprietary\nAI models right but if deep seek has\nproven that you can do it a lot cheaper\nwith less Advanced chips and with lower\nbudgets then this could create a wider\nadoption of AI from startup companies\nfrom academic lab from smaller\nEnterprises so this would result in a\nlarger overall user base that will\nincrease the aggregate demand for AI\nrelated Hardware which means you still\nneed a lot more Hardware as as as we\ngrow in this AI Revolution and this\nwould offset a lower demand per\nmodel at the same time even if one\nsolution which is llms is more efficient\nthere'll be a rise among the\nhyperscalers to deploy more advanced or\nspecialized models that could keep the\ndemand for advanced chips high so like\nit or not we are in an AI race and I\nbelieve that your hypers scalers again\nlike Amazon and meta they will still\nwant the best of the best chips in order\nto gain an age and if you think about it\nthe other way now that China has proven\nthat it's catching up with the us if you\nare the US companies will you be more\nfrightened yes like damn the Chinese are\ncatching up so all the more you may not\nwant to cut back on your cacks all the\nmore you may say I want to spend more\nand get the best chips and the most\nadvanced ships so that I can take it\neven further right so it may swing the\nother way as well so if you ask me am I\n100% convinced that this news will lower\nthe demand for NVIDIA chips I'm not\nconvinced all right I'm not saying it's\nnot going to happen but I'm not 100%\nconvinced so because of that like I said\nI'm going to maintain my position I'm\nnot going to panic and sell but at the\nsame time before I add more shares I'm\ngoing to make sure that I got a good\ndiscount and I'm looking at it from an\ninvestment longterm perspective now if\nyou happen to be a short-term Trader not\na long-term investor and of course it's\na different story if you're a short-term\nTrader then you you purely trade based\non the price action you ignore the news\nlook at a price action if Nvidia drops\nand you notice a double bottom pattern\nor a slingshot pattern which which I\nteach in my course or alson teaches his\nuh downtrend reversal pattern uh then\nyou take the trade right take a trade\nand you put your stop loss put your\nprofit targets and you could play the\nrebound and you never know the rebound\ncould come faster than you think so I do\nhope this has given you a more\ncomprehensive perspective of what's\nHappening uh in this situation and
