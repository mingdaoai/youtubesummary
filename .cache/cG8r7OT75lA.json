{"transcript": "Today we're going to talk about five\nstartups I would build if I were in my\n20s today for under $500.\nNow I built and sold three venturebacked\nstartups in my 20s. It absolutely\nchanged my life. So, you know, hopefully\nsomeone listens to some of these ideas.\nIt gets their creative juices flowing. I\nthink this is particularly valuable for\npeople in their 20s, but if you're 35 or\n48 or or 15, I still think that this is\nuh these are ideas that you can go ahead\nand and do.\n[Music]\nSo, the first idea is a a first job\nrejection tracker. So, uh, the idea is\nlog all your job applications, track\nresponse rates by company enroll, get\ninsight on what's working, and connect\nwith others who got rejected from the\nsame place. Now, if you're in college or\nyou just graduated college, you you\nknow, you know a lot of people who are\njust trying to get their first jobs, but\nI don't think that there's like a\nlevels. FYI for college. Now, if you\ndon't know levels.fyi, FYI,\nit shows how much people get paid at all\nthese different tech companies. So, it\nbasically, you know, if you're a product\nmanager at Amazon, uh based on, you\nknow, certain uh levels like a senior\nPM, you know, you're going to get\n$37,000 Canadian dollars, for example.\nSo, it breaks it all it all down and it\nbasically gives transparency\nto something that, you know, not a lot\nof people talked about. It was it was\nbehind closed doors. Now I think that\nthere's an opportunity to do a similar\nthing around first jobs. So it's sort of\na niche of this um and and you know you\nbeing in your 20s you understand uh you\nknow these people going through these\nfirst jobs uh you know first job\napplications and stuff like that. So I\nthink that the you know why it's easy to\nget started. You can start with\nsomething like a notion template, a\nZapier automation. You can use a Discord\nCircle or school community to bring\npeople together. But your first steps\nare going to be crowdsource the data.\nStart with one company, expand from\nthere. Use short form bids to drive\nawareness. So, um yeah, when I mean by\nstart with one company, I mean like you\nknow maybe you just start with people\napplying at um you know Proctor and\nGamble, people who want to work at\nGoldman Sachs. Uh and then you start\nfrom there. So that's idea number one.\nUh let's go to idea number two. So uh\nthis one is called takeyou headphones\noff.com and this is just a paid\ncommunity idea. I think a lot of people\nin your 20s it's easy to start a paid\ncommunity, right? because, you know, you\ncan go and sign up to school and and uh\nand circle. I'll include links to those\nin in the show notes. Um, and you can\njust you just need to come up with a\nunique niche that's super valuable. So,\nyou know, takeyouphones off.com is a\npaid community for people addicted to\ntech and screens. And who's addicted to\ntech and screens? You know, you know, a\nlot. It's young people, right? I mean,\nwe're all addicted, let's be real. But,\nuh, you get it, right? So, um, daily get\noffline text reminders, weekly IRL\nmeetups in major cities, accountability\npartners, digital detox challenge. I\nthink that there's a mega opportunity to\nto own the brand around taking your\nheadphones off. Um, why it's easy to get\nstarted, you can start with a circle or\nschool community. You can use a Twilio\nfor text. You can use Eventbrite or\nParticiple probably uh for, you know,\nmeetups. Um, you know, you can start a\nfree Discord group. Um, you know, tweet\nwho else feels like their phones own\nthem. I just think that what I'm seeing\nfrom a content perspective is there's\ntons of people uh who feel like their uh\nphones own them. And I think you can\ncharge a monthly fee, $9, $12, $19 a\nmonth um and and sort of host these\nmeetups in a bunch of different cities.\nSo, really easy to get started, you\nknow, really doesn't cost you a lot of\nmoney and you could get a nice monthly\nrecurring 10K a month uh from something\nlike that. The third idea uh is an\nagency. Now, agencies are are just\nthey're just easier to start than, you\nknow, tech companies. Um so, I included\na couple ideas here. So, uh it's a\ncreator and residence agency. So,\nbasically brands that suck at social,\nconnect them with micro creators. You\nknow them. you're in your 20s, you know,\npeople who are who are creators who need\nsteady pay and take 20% of the contract.\nSo, you're basically like a recruiting\nfirm, but uh you're placing micro\ncreators and and creators, basically\nyour friends who know how to create Tik\nToks, know, you know, understand cap\ncut. That's uh I think this is a mega\nopportunity. I I don't see why this\ncan't be a 1 2 3 $5 million year\nopportunity. Um it's pretty easy to get\nstarted. You can lean on DMing creators.\nIf you don't know the creators, you can\nuse an air table to store uh who these\ncreators are. Um, you know, list willing\ncreators, list brands. You can just play\na matchmaker via Zoom. You don't need to\nbuild or code. Uh, you don't need to\nbuild an app. You don't need a code.\nLike, you can just use that. Um, and\nit's good for someone who's kind of a\nhustler who's going to go and like\nconvince these creators to sign on and\nconvince these brands that they need to\nhire a uh creator in residence. And I I\nI'm giving away this I don't think this\nexists like this name creator and\nresidence agency. I think that is you\nknow a good name because you know people\nare looking for these creators and\nresidents. So you know the first step is\nif you're trying to create uh if you're\ngo if you're trying to create um this\nthis startup is you know post just\nlooking for brands. I want a creator on\npayroll on LinkedIn um and then you can\nsource creators from X Instagram that\nsort of thing. So, um, this whole idea\naround creators on payroll, I think it's\nnew. I think someone who's young could\nstart an agency around this is probably\nbest, uh, suited for it. The fourth idea\nis uh, the 2K vibe coding agency. So,\nbasically doing two week sprints um,\nbuilding micro SAS using chat, GBT,\nBolt, Lovable, Replet, and Cursor. So,\nyou basically go and you just you have\none product. You're a productized\nservice. you sell, you sell these\nsprints for $2,000, basically products\nfor $2,000. Um, and you know, they're,\nyou know, they're teaching you you\nthese, you're you're getting these\nclients and they're teaching you to\nbecome better and better, you know,\nprompt engineers and also just vibe\ncoders. So, I think that, you know, just\nan, you know, a great way to learn how\nto become incredible at vibe coding is\nto just get paid to do it. So, yes,\nyou're not getting paid 20K or 25K or\nwhatever, but um you know, you're\nspending uh you know, a couple weeks\nbuilding these MVPs for people, giving\nthem value, you're getting 2K in return.\nAnd I think just this idea around\nbranding it around and again, like I\ndon't know if it's $2,000 or a,000 or or\n3500 or if it's two weeks or one week\nsprints. Um but the idea is owning that\nproductized service around vibe coding.\nhuge opportunity and will take you from,\nyou know, an okay vibe coder to an\nincredible vibe coder. And you're going\nto learn from that whole experience.\nYou're actually going to learn about,\nyou know, maybe there's a micro SAS that\nyou end up wanting to create. Maybe\nthere's a um a full-on SAS that you want\nto create. So I think that you spend one\nyear, two years doing this, maybe it\nmakes 300k a year, 500k a year of\nrevenue, but the big insights is what\nyou're going to learn from uh building\nthese products for other people, SAS\nproducts for other people. And uh you\nknow, it's going to it's going to get\nyour creative juices flowing. The fifth\nidea is um just, you know, I called it\nhookline studio. So basically, you paste\na video idea and you get 10 catchy Tik\nTok hook lines in 30 seconds. So, you\nknow, this does require you to be\nsomewhat of a vibe coder. You would have\nto use something like cursor, but you\nknow, you basically create this single\ntext bomb box. It goes to a GPT prompt.\nIt lists the hooks. You can embed it on\nTypedream. And if you, you know, if you\nwanted to actually get this, you know,\nthe first steps that I would do if I was\ntrying to build something like this is I\nscreen record the flow. I'd say, you\nknow, steal these hooks for free. And\nthen I would upsell to a $9 a month\nunlimited hook uh, you know, product.\nSo, I think that there's there's an\nopportunity to build a product around\nhooks, Tik Tok hooks, and you obviously,\nyou know, being young, understand what\nhooks are good, what hooks aren't good.\nUm, and you could just curate that\ndatabase over time. Uh, curate those\nprompts over time. And I bet you that\nthere's a few hundred, you know, K ARR\nbusiness probably, you know, behind\nsomething like that. And the last idea\nwhich came to me um but I I I preface it\nwith like I don't know if it's legal but\nit's basically I think that it would be\ncool if this existed. So I'm not I don't\nknow if anyone should do this because I\ndon't know if it's legal. It it operates\nunder the gray area. Uh this isn't you\nknow financial advice. This isn't legal\nadvice but wouldn't you know I've been\nlooking at Poly Market. I'm sure a lot\nof you have seen this um where people\nbasically use crypto crypto to predict\nwhere uh where the world is going to go.\nSo for example, you know, people say\nZoran Madi 72% chance of him winning the\nNew York uh mayor election or there\nthere you know how many Fed cut rates in\n2025 and 26% of people say one. So I\nthink there's an opportunity to create\nlike poly market for\nuh college campuses or just you know\nyoung people you know six uh 18 call it\nto 22. So I think there's an opportunity\nthere. I did a little bit of research\nbefore this. I I just asked perplexity\nto say like is this legal and it said it\noperates in a gray area. Um, so I don't\nknow, but I I I think that this idea\naround students basically betting on the\ndeans list, which couples break up, who\ngets kicked out of Greek life, class\ncurve predictions, um, would be kind of\nan interesting model. And then you would\nobviously take, uh, a 5% rate uh, rate\nin it. So these are just a few, you\nknow, that's why I include that one as a\nbonus. By the way, um these are just a\nfew, you know, a few ideas that I would\ndo if I were in my 20s. Um you know,\nthey don't cost a lot to get going. I\nthink my probably my favorite one is is\nthe first one, the first job rejection\ntracker. Um because I think it's it's\ntiny, but it could actually end up\nbecoming quite big. Um but all of these,\nyou know, five ideas you're going to\nlearn you're going to learn something\nfrom. You're going to learn something\nfrom and they don't cost a lot to get\ngoing. Um, and I think there they are\nideas that could expand from there. So,\nhope this has been helpful. Um, you\nknow, I'm trying to do, you know, more\nidea episodes on the Startup Ideas\npodcast to get your creative juices\nflowing. If you're looking for more\nideas, uh, you can always go to\nideabrowser.com. This is something that\nI created to give people startup ideas\nevery single day. So, I literally built\nthis for myself and now I'm sharing it\nwith you. Um, I can't wait to see what\nyou build and just comment uh on the\nYouTube video. I read every single\ncomment just what you're thinking about\nthe first thing that comes to your mind\nand then hit that like button as well.\nUm, so I know to keep creating videos.\nIt just gives me an idea around uh if\nyou're liking this or you're not liking\nthis or what you want to see. So, hope\nthis has been helpful. Have a creative\nday, my friends, and I'll see you on the\ninternet.", "language": "en", "title": "5 Businesses I'd Start If I Was 22 Again ($500 → $100k/Month)"}
