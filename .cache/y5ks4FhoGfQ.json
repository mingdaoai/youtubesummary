{"transcript": "So, you want to make a million bucks? I\ngot you. If you just focus for the next\n30 minutes, I will give you a simple\nthree-step blueprint to make a million\ndollars from scratch with no experience\nor investment. Or you could get\ndistracted, go back to doom scrolling,\nand wonder why you're not making\nprogress in life. I'm not your\nbabysitter. The choice is yours. My\nname's Mica. Micaia. Micaia Rson. I\nbuilt and sold my last company for $110\nmillion, which means I can freely share\nthe exact systems I used to achieve\nfinancial freedom. Now, if you're tired\nof slaving away in your 9 to5, feel\nfrustrated by your lack of progress on\nyour business, or have tried a business\nbefore only to fail, you might worry\ndeep down that maybe you're just not\ngood enough. I remember about 7 years\ninto entrepreneurship, I still only had\n$1,600 to my name and I was $30,000 in\ndebt. But it turns out the reason my\nbusinesses kept failing wasn't because I\nwas a bad entrepreneur. It was because I\nwas trying to start businesses in\nmarkets where I had to create my own\nmomentum by beating competitors and\ncarving my niche into a market that\nalready exists. It's like pushing a\nboulder uphill. But the real way to\nbuild life-changing wealth fast is to\nfind a billion-dollar market so\ndesperate for a solution that it's like\npushing a boulder downhill. You just\nhave to get the beginning right and then\nwinning is almost automatic. So, how do\nyou find billion-dollar desperate\nmarkets? This is the exact method I used\nto come up with the business idea that I\nsold for $110 million that I actually\nlearned from Jeff Bezos. You see, before\nJeff Bezos founded Amazon, he was a New\nYork City man in finance working at a\nhedge fund called De Shaw. And every\nyear, De Shaw would invest millions of\ndollars trying to figure out what market\ntrends were happening because they knew\nif they spotted the right trends early\ncould be worth billions. But then one\nday, Jeff came across a report so crazy\nhe quit his million-dollar job\nimmediately after reading it. So, what\ndo you think was in the report? The\nreport showed data on the web usage\nstatistics of households. And that\nnumber was growing at\n2300% year-over-year. And Jeff was a\nsmart man. He knew that this was going\nto disrupt a massive market, traditional\nshopping, as more people considered\nbuying things online. So, he quit his\njob and started an online bookstore\ncalled Amazon. And this one little data\npoint and insight turned him into one of\nthe wealthiest men to ever live. So, let\nme show you a dead simple way to use\nthis exact technique to come up with\nyour own million-dollar insights. The\nmost important thing you need is data on\nmarket trends and the biggest\ndisruptions happening in different\nmarkets. But finding that data can be\nchallenging. It's why these firms spend\nmillions of dollars a year every year to\nfind them. Thankfully, there's an easy\ntrick. See, there are consulting firms\nthat hire hordes of analysts to comb\nthrough all the data and try to find the\nbiggest market disruptions happening\ntoday. And what's crazy is they give\nthese reports away for free. Why?\nBecause their actual business model is\nselling consulting to giant companies\nfor millions of dollars. So they release\nthese little reports and white papers as\na way to get the attention of these\ngiant companies. But this is where the\nmagic comes in. Instead of you doing all\nthat research, you can leverage the\nliterally hundreds of thousands of\nanalysts already working on these\nreports and get them for free from these\nbig firms. The big three are McKenzie,\nBCG, and Bane, but there are dozens of\nothers. But don't waste your time trying\nto Google them. I've already made a\nhandy doc that has links to all the best\nresearch firms reports for free. So,\nI'll put a link in the description\nbelow. It will save you hundreds of\nhours of time. Just go there and get it\nfor free. And then as you're reading\nreports, I want you to look for three\nspecific things. First is a change\nthat's creating new opportunities. For\nexample, when I was building ideas for\nmy own startup, we saw that the\npercentage of people wanting to buy cars\nonline was 48% up from 35% the year\nbefore. And then the second thing you're\ngoing to look for is a gap in existing\nsolutions. So for us, we did some quick\nGoogling and it showed us that car\ndealerships actually couldn't sell cars\nonline. So then we knew we had a problem\nand a gap in the solutions available.\nBut the third thing we needed to check\nwas the size of the market. See, if you\nchoose a small market, you need to\ndominate the field just to make good\nmoney. Instead, you should play in\nmarkets so large that you can just take\na small slice of the pie and still make\nmore money than you know what to do\nwith. Now, my simple formula for\nfiguring out if a market is worth\nentering is to take the number of\ncustomers that would buy your product\ntimes the price that you think you could\nsell it for. and that has to be greater\nthan a billion dollars. So, here's how\nthe math worked for my own startup.\nFirst, I Googled how many car\ndealerships are there in the US. Google\nsays there are\n48,133 new and used car dealerships.\nNext, I Googled how much are car\ndealerships currently paying for\nsoftware. And I learned that dealerships\noften buy software for $2,000 to $5,000\nper month. I'll just call it 3,000 or\n$36,000 per year. So, then I just plug\nin my formula.\n48,133 dealerships times $36,000 per\nyear equals $1.7 billion. So, this\nopportunity passes the check. And that's\nthe exact math I did when I started this\nbusiness that I sold for $110 million.\nSo, congrats. We're just a few minutes\ninto this video, and you've already\nlearned my exact formula to find\nmillion-dollar business ideas, and you\ngot it for free. Now, if you appreciate\nthe value I'm giving here, I'd love it\nif you subscribe to the channel so I\nknow that these videos are helpful. Now,\nonce you've come up with your\nopportunity, you still need to be very\ncareful because the right business idea\nwith the wrong business model can still\neasily fail. So, it's critical at this\nstage that you avoid building what I\ncall a low-lever business. I found out\nwhat a low-lever business was the hard\nway. Right after college, I was running\na marketing agency, and on paper, I was\ndoing great. I was just 21 years old,\ncharging clients $300 an hour. But\nbecause I was in a lowleveraged business\nmodel, I was ultimately still just a\nslave to my time, trading my time for\nmoney. Congrats, you traded your 9 to5\nfor 24/7. But even worse, I wasn't\nbuilding any real wealth. See, when you\nrun a lowle leverage business, you as\nthe owner increase your net worth by\nessentially sales minus expenses and\nthen leftover profit to you. So if you\nmake $100,000 in sales, maybe you have\n$50,000 in costs. So at the end of the\nday, your personal net worth only\nincreases by 50 grand. A high leverage\nbusiness, on the other hand, means every\nhour of work you do is greatly\nmultiplied, allowing you to build wealth\nsignificantly faster while working less\nhard. For example, take the same\n$100,000 in sales from our last example,\nbut pump it through a highle leveraged\nbusiness. And your personal net worth\ncan increase by $1 million or more. And\nmaybe that sounds like a pipe dream, but\nthat's what's known as a 10x revenue\nmultiple. And it's not so crazy. In\nfact, let me give you some comparisons\nfor some businesses that you've probably\nalready heard of. For example, for the\nlast 5 years, Shopify has traded at a\n29x revenue multiple, meaning that for\nevery $100,000 of revenue they generate,\nthe business is worth $2.9 million more.\nAnd if you think that's crazy, Adobe\ntried to buy Figma for 50x revenue. So,\nlet me show you exactly how to build a\nhigh leverage business. Any high\nleverage business needs four things.\nFirst is a recurring revenue model.\nThere's a reason every single product\nunder the sun now is becoming a\nsubscription. It's sell once and make\nmoney repeatedly. So whatever you sell,\nwhether it's toothbrushes or software,\nit needs to be something that the\ncustomers use every month and buy\nrepeatedly. Second, you need high profit\nmargins on your core product, usually at\nleast 70%. Which means if you sell your\nproduct for $100 a month, it should cost\nless than $30 per month per customer.\nAnd there's two ways to get there. You\ncan either mark your product up to a\ncertain percentage or sell a digital\nproduct like a community, a course, or a\nsoftware product where your costs are\nnaturally very low. The third thing you\nneed is a business that scales through\ntechnology, not people. If every time\nyou add a new customer, you need to add\npeople to the business to manage that\ncustomer, your business is a nightmare\nto run and will always struggle with\nprofitability. That means no agencies,\nno consulting, and no physical products.\nWhile those work, they're just messy\nbusinesses to run and you're better off\navoiding them. And then fourth, you need\nto be selling your own product, not\nsomeone else's. If you don't own what\nyou build, the terms of the arrangement\ncan always change or any other slick\nmarketer can come in and sell the same\nproduct as you, and then you get into\npricing wars. So that means no affiliate\nmarketing and no drop shipping. You can\nhire someone to build the product, but\nultimately what you sell needs to be\nyour product. Now, if you just combine\nthe concept of a billion-dollar\ndesperate market with a high leveraged\nbusiness, you will already be ahead of\n99% of entrepreneurs. But there are\nstill two critical mistakes that can\nlead to failure when if you had just\nacquired the right knowledge, you could\nhave been successful. The first mistake\nis the what, how, who dilemma. And I\nlearned this one the hard way when I was\ntrying to get our first customers at my\nstartup. I was calling hundreds of\npotential customers a day. And I kept\ngetting people that really liked my idea\nand my product, but then they didn't\nbuy. So, one day I decided I'm going to\nrecord all the sales calls I'm doing and\nsee if I could listen back and figure\nout what was going wrong. And listening\nback to the recordings one day, it hit\nme. I was selling the product all wrong.\nAnd if you're making the same mistake I\nwas, doesn't matter how good your\nproduct or marketing is, no one will\nbuy. So, let me break down the what, how\ndilemma so you can avoid it. First is\nthe what. In order to make any sale, you\nneed to figure out what your buyer\nwants. It's a live conversation. get\ncurious about what they want. What\nproblems are they trying to solve? Or\nwhat are their desired outcomes from\nbuying? Or if it's a marketing message,\nyou're going to call out the what in\nyour message. Don't call out the\nfeatures or the functions of your\nproduct. You're calling out what change\nwill happen in their life if they buy\nyour product. And then once you've\nnailed the what, you need to nail the\nhow. As in how will you deliver these\nchanges you promised in your what. This\nis where you walk through your\nproprietary technology, your benefits,\nor whatever it is that you do\nspecifically to give them what they\nwant. If your buyer doesn't believe your\nhow will solve their what, there's no\nsale. But then once they do believe, the\nlast step is actually the most important\nbecause if you've identified what they\nwant and how they will get it, the only\nreason they might not buy from you is\nbecause they don't believe you can\nactually deliver on the promises you've\nmade. So to close any deal, you need to\nexplain why you or your company are the\nbest option for them. This is where\npricing, testimonials, reviews, and\ncommitments to service all come into\nplay. And so in my own startup, as soon\nas I added some slides to my sales\npresentation about me, the company, who\nwe were, our credentials, our\nbackgrounds, etc., people started\nbuying. And if you simply followed the\nwhat, how, who framework, you can sell\nanything to anyone. But of course,\nsometimes you'll run this process and\nyou won't close the deal. Or even worse,\nwhat if you're selling the wrong product\nentirely and you don't even realize it?\nYou could spend months or even years\nwasting your life with no chances of\nsuccess. So to make sure this doesn't\nhappen to you, you need a way to make\nbusiness progress quickly without\nwasting time or taking on unnecessary\nrisks. And the way you do that is by\nusing what I call the lean learning\nloop. This is something we developed at\nmy startup and it's essentially\ncombining the best principles from the\nlean startup by Eric Reese and first\nprincipal thinking made famous by Elon\nMusk. Here's how you use it. First,\nwhenever you have a goal, you're going\nto list out all of your best hypotheses\non how to achieve that goal. To make\nthis concrete, I'll use an example.\nLet's pretend I'm a chef. I run a\ncooking blog and I want to find a way to\nmake some more money from my website.\nSo, my goal is to make extra money from\nmy blog. So step one, I write my ideas\ndown as hypothesis. And my hypothesis is\nthat if I write a book, people will buy\nit. But how do I know if they will\nactually buy it? So step two, I need to\ndesign tests to validate or invalidate\nthis hypothesis in the leanest way\npossible. Sure, I could write the book\nand put it for sale, but that's a lot of\ntime and effort to risk. And as a new\nentrepreneur, you do not want to be\ntaking big risks on your time and\neffort. So, I'm going to come up with\nthe leanest idea possible, which in this\nexample, I'm going to add a new page to\nmy website that says, \"Buy my book.\" And\nI'll make a landing page that says,\n\"Hey, thanks so much for stopping by.\nYou know, I'm thinking about writing a\nbook. If you'd be interested, leave your\nemail below and I'll let you know when\nit comes out.\" And that might take me an\nhour. I can launch that page, add a link\nto it in my navigation, and then start\ncollecting data. So, step three is I\nwant to collect this data and draw\nconclusions to loop back to the original\nidea. So, let's say at the end of 2\nweeks, I look at the data and say, hm,\nmy blog has gotten 30,000 visits. And\nyou know what? I got 3,000 clicks to the\nbuy my book page. And with a bit of\nGoogling, I learn that on Amazon, as a\ncomparison, 10% of people that view a\nbook on Amazon buy that book. So, I sit\nback and say, well, you know, if I have\n3,000 people visit and 10% buy, that's\n300 books every 2 weeks or 600 books a\nmonth. Wow, if I sell the book for 20\nbucks, that's an extra $12,000 a month.\nThat's pretty good. And now I can write\nthat book and put in all the time and\neffort because I've already validated\nthe idea as a valid way to add revenue\nto the business. So these two frameworks\nwill save you so much time when you're\nstarting your business. But now it's\ntime to show you how to actually start\nthe business. So step two, launch your\nbusiness. If you're like most\nentrepreneurs, you probably think step\none is to build the product, right?\nAfter all, no product, no sales. But\nthis is actually the worst thing you can\ndo when you build a business and one of\nthe fastest ways to fail in business.\nOkay, so we're not going to build the\nproduct first. But can you guess what\nwe're going to do instead? We're going\nto sell the product. Yeah, sell it. I\nsold more than half a million dollars of\nmy product at my startup before we ever\nbuilt the product. So that when we did\ndecide to build it, we knew immediately\nwe'd have paying customers before we\never risked a dollar of our own money.\nAnd so let me show you how to do that\nstep by step. You're going to build\nwhat's known as a cap, a customer\nadvisory board. This takes the entire\nsales process and sales resistance that\nyou typically encounter early on and\nflips it on its head. So, what you're\ngoing to do is you're going to build a\nlist of ideal customers and reach out to\nat least 50 per day. But, you're not\ngoing to try to sell them anything.\nInstead, you're going to ask them for\nhelp. Your framing and basic script for\nthis is, hey, I'm an entrepreneur\nbuilding solutions for people like you\nand I would love to have a brief\nconversation about your job, business,\nlife so that I can make sure I'm\nbuilding the best product possible.\nWould you be open to a brief chat\nsometime? And because you're just\ngenuinely asking for help, a lot of\npeople that would normally say no to a\nsales conversation will actually get on\nthe phone with you. Then when you get\nthem on the phone, you do actually ask\nthem for advice. You're not just like a\nsales hack where you trick them into\nbuying something. You actually want to\ninterview them because it's business\ngold. So ask them about your product.\nAsk them about the problems that they're\nencountering and if they think what\nyou're building would solve those\nproblems. And then after they've given\nthe advice, you're going to say, \"Hey,\nyou know what? This was so valuable. I'd\nlove to find a way for us to continue\nthese conversations occasionally where\ncreating a customer advisory board.\nWould you be interested in joining by\nchance?\" By calling it something and\nmaking it sound official, people already\nhave a higher perceived status of it and\nthey'll be interested because it sounds\nimportant. But what you say next is\ncritical. You're going to explain to\nthem how it works. And here's the exact\npitch I want you to use. You're going to\nsay, \"Listen, we're putting together a\nsmall group of innovative industry\nleaders to help guide our product\ndevelopment and shape the product that\nwe're building. As part of the customer\nadvisory board, you'd get the benefit of\nhaving direct access to our team and a\nvoice to shape the road map. So, we make\nsure we're building the best product for\nyou. And of course, to do that, you need\nto actually be using the product. But\ndon't worry, if you're interested in\njoining, we'd give you a lifetime\ndiscount of 50 to 70%. I really like 70%\nhere, but you can choose your own\nnumber. But then you follow up and say,\nso you'd actually be getting an insane\ndeal. Now, all we ask in return is that\nyou actually use the product, give us\nhonest feedback, and also let us use\nyour success as a reference as we grow\nour business. If you're interested, let\nme know. I can send over the paperwork,\nwhich by the way also makes it sound way\nmore official. And then you ease their\nworries by telling them, \"Listen, this\nisn't a binding agreement to buy our\nproduct. It's just an LOI, a letter of\ninterest, which lets us lock in your\nplace on the cab, so we reserve your\nspot and we know you're serious about\nthis.\" And that's it. Just repeat this\nuntil you get your first 10 customers\nlined up. Then you start building your\nproduct. But now we need to talk about\nactually building your product because\nbuilding the wrong product is the number\none startup killer with 42% of startups\ndying because they built the wrong\nproduct even though they had paying\ncustomers. And the biggest mistake you\ncan make at this stage is trying to\nbuild a really impressive product that\njust wows your customers at every level.\nYou might think this is best, but this\nonly leads to slower development times,\nmore wasted money, and ultimately kills\nthe business. So at this stage, you\nactually need to take the complete\nopposite approach and build what I call\na black car product. It's inspired by\none of the greatest entrepreneurs of all\ntime, Henry Ford, and his famous quote,\n\"Any customer can have a car painted any\ncolor that he wants so long as it is\nblack.\" And this is the perfect metaphor\nfor building your first product. Your\nproduct should be a black car product, a\nproduct so narrowly scoped that it is a\nsingular tool designed to solve one\nproblem and one problem only. And until\nyou've sold that product and solved that\nproblem repeatedly, you do not build\nadditional features to solve additional\nproblems. Now, of course, you don't want\nto make every sale and build the product\nall by yourselves. You probably want to\nget some leverage and start freeing up\nyour time. So, it's time to hire some\npeople, but hiring people is often one\nof the worst things you can ever do to\nyour business. See, beginner\nentrepreneurs think more people equals\nfaster progress. But experienced\nentrepreneurs know more people also\nequals more management overhead and more\npeople problems. So if your business\nisn't actually prepared to handle that,\nit will grind your business to a halt as\nyou spend all your time putting out\nfires and fixing mistakes instead of\nactually moving the business forward.\nThe solution for this is to build what I\ncall a pizza squad. It's inspired by\nJeff Bezos's two pizza rule, which\nstated that no meetings at Amazon should\nhave more people than two pizzas could\nadequately feed. In practice, this means\nroughly five to eight people. And this\nis the perfect size for an early stage\nbusiness. As an entrepreneur, you should\ndo everything in your power to keep the\nteam under eight people until you hit $1\nmillion in sales. You will get there so\nmuch faster if you can keep it lean and\nmove quickly. Now, at this point, your\nbusiness is growing. You've got happy\ncustomers, but you still haven't\nachieved the life of your dreams. So,\nstep three is all about how to grow the\nbusiness while freeing yourself from the\nbusiness dayto-day. And at this point,\nthe number one choke down your business\nis actually you. Or more specifically,\nit's your mindset. To help you\nunderstand, I need to reveal a bit of a\ndirty secret about Silicon Valley that\nno one wants to admit. See, when I first\narrived in Silicon Valley, I had this\ndream of founders growing these\ncompanies from the ground up from their\ngarage to their penthouse offices\noverlooking the world. But after a few\nmonths there, I started noticing a\ndisturbing trend. founders were getting\nfired from their own companies left and\nright. I mean, just look at Sequoia\nCapital, arguably the best tech investor\non the planet. They get to look at\nthousands of companies every year, and\nthey only invest in a small handful, the\ntrue.1% of the best companies on the\nplanet. And yet, even amongst these best\nof the best companies, Sequoia Capital\nfires 45% of the founding CEOs that they\ninvest in within 18 months of their\ninitial investment. So, what the heck is\ngoing on here? Sequoia Capital knows\nsomething you don't. Early stage\ncompanies grow at an extremely rapid\nrate, often doubling or tripling revenue\nevery year, the first few years. And\nwhile this sounds great, it represents a\nhuge problem for the CEOs of those\ncompanies. Because the CEOs of those\ncompanies also have to grow their skills\nand capabilities 200 to 300%\nyear-over-year or they will end up being\nthe chokeold on the entire business. But\nleveling up your skills two to 3x every\nyear is nearly a full-time job. Which is\nwhy so many CEOs fail to pass the test.\nWhen I was building my startup, I was\nabsolutely determined to not be one of\nthose CEOs that got fired. So, I built\nwhat I called my triad of influence,\nwhich allowed me to make leveling up\nautomatic. Here's how you can build one,\ntoo. Now, the triad of influence\nconsists of three categories of people\nthat are going to grow you. First are\nyour peers. They're going to inspire\nyou, encourage you, and you can learn\nalongside them. To find them, you can\njoin meetup groups, join peer groups, go\nto conferences, you know, set up co-work\nsessions. But you want to have at least\nfive people in your life in this\ncategory that are your peers. Second are\nyour mentors. These are people a few\nyears ahead of you on the journey.\nThey're going to help you avoid the\npotholes along the road, sharing their\nwisdom and potentially saving you years\nof time. You can also use these people\nwhen you are panicking and need answers\nquick. Now, a warning. It's important\nthat these people are not your investors\nbecause you want pure unbiased advice,\nnot someone who's just trying to save\ntheir own investment. So, one way to\nfind these people is cold outreach via\nemail or Instagram DMs. But actually\nreferrals from your peers are by far the\nbest method and the one that I use. And\nwhat you want to do is you want to grab\ncoffee with these people roughly every\nmonth or so and give them progress\nupdates. For this category, I recommend\nyou get three mentors that have agreed\nto grab coffee with you regularly. And\nthen the last category you want in your\ntri of influence are heroes. Now these\nare people who have achieved the dream\nlife you want. And early on I actually\ndon't recommend cold outreach to these\npeople. the gap between where you are\nand them is simply too large and it's\ngoing to be hard to get in the room with\nthem and actually be able to have a real\nconversation. So, the best way to get\nthese heroes into your life and to get\ntheir knowledge into your head is to\nconsume content from them. So, to do\nthat, here are three books from\nbillionaires that really inspired me and\nwill teach you everything you need to\nknow. First is The Hard Thing About Hard\nThings by Ben Horowitz. Second is Shoe\nDog by Phil Knight, the founder of Nike.\nAnd third is total recall by Arnold\nSchwarzenegger who is now also a\nbillionaire. Now with your triad of\ninfluence in place, let's talk about how\nyou can tactically actually free\nyourself from day-to-day operations and\ngrow the business faster than ever. See,\nin the early days of your business,\nyou'll be throwing lots of stuff at the\nwall to see what sticks and what\ndoesn't. And the biggest trap you can\nrun into at this stage is trying to look\nat what doesn't stick and say, \"Hey,\nwhat can we do to fix this?\" This common\nmindset is rational, but it's actually\nthe fastest way to fail as a business.\nInstead, you should focus on what's\nsticking. Take a look at everything\nyou've tried in the last year and say,\n\"Are there patterns to what we're doing\nwhere it's working? Are there certain\ncompany sizes that tend to buy from us\nmore? Is there a certain email sequence\nthat converts more customers?\" Find the\npatterns in what's working in your\nbusiness already and double down on\nthem. These will become your superpowers\nfor growing your business. And then what\nyou're going to do is take these\nsuperpowers and scale them so that they\ncan run on autopilot without your\ninvolvement. To do this, you're going to\nfollow the document and delegate method.\nSo first is the documentation. You're\ngoing to take the highest performing\nparts of the business and turn them into\nplaybooks that anyone can follow. The\nbest way to do this is to actually\nrecord yourself doing the activity and\nthen write a document to go along with\nit explaining every single step so\ncarefully that anyone regardless of\nskill level or training could read\nthrough the playbook and execute the\nsteps. And to get even more leverage,\nyou don't have to be the one writing\nthis playbook. In fact, you probably\nshouldn't be at this stage. You really\nwant the best person in your company at\nthat specific task recording themselves\nand writing the playbook. So, your best\ncloser writes a playbook for closing\ndeals. so on and so forth. Second,\nyou're going to delegate. You're going\nto either hire or promote your best\npeople to be department leads and have\nthem hire, train, and manage other\npeople to execute on the playbooks. Now,\nas you're doing this, don't forget the\nlean learning loop. You can't just run\nthe playbooks as written forever. You\nneed to be constantly testing new ideas,\nseeing what works, and building a\nprocess of continuous improvement for\neach playbook of your department. and\nbefore you know it, you'll have a\nmulti-million dollar business cranking\naway that requires little involvement or\ntime from you, leaving you time to live\nyour life of freedom and happiness. Now,\nthere's one thing I left on this video,\nbut it's critical to your success, and\nthat's a millionaire's mindset. Because\nif you're trying to become the first\nmillionaire in your family, chances are\nthere are lessons about money and wealth\nyou simply haven't learned yet, and the\nlack of knowledge there will hold you\nback. So, I made a video about how to\nbecome the first millionaire in your\nfamily. I'll put a link to it over here.\nI hope it helps and I'll see you in that", "language": "en-US", "title": "Give me 24 Minutes and I'll Teach You How to Make $1M"}
