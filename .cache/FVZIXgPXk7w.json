{"transcript": "hi this is Adam Co here and today I'm\ngoing to share of you the most important\nsecret to successful investing you guys\nready so the most important ingredient\nto achieving consistent profits in\ninvesting is to buy low and sell high is\nto buy cheap and sell expensive now I\nknow some of you are looking at me right\nnow and thinking yeah you're a genius of\ncourse I know that but it's e easier set\nthan done like how do I know when\nsomething's cheap and how do I know when\nsomething's expensive because sometimes\nlooking at the absolute price can be\nvery misleading for example let's take a\nlook at two stocks right now Robin Hood\nTI a symbol h o and meta\nplatforms Robin Hood is currently\nselling at\n$19 per share and meta platforms is\nselling at\n$467 per share so which stock is cheaper\nand which is more expensive now most\namateur investors would say of course\nthis is cheaper it's only 19 bucks this\nis so expensive $467 it's gone up so\nmuch ever since the last two years well\nwrong I'm going to prove to you in this\nvideo that in fact Robin Hood At $19 is\nexpensive and meta platforms at\n$467 is still the cheap why because the\nabsolute price means nothing unless you\nknow what is the intrinsic value of the\nstock and then base the current share\nprice on that intrinsic value so this\nwas a lesson I learned many many years\nago over 16 years ago when I was not as\nsmart as I am today right so many years\nago I remember that I bought this stock\nuh from the Singapore Stock Exchange it\nwas called L&M it was a construction\ncompany that was selling at three\nSingapore 4 cents now why did I buy this\nstock because it looks so cheap I said\nthree cents how low can it\ngo and at the same time I remember at a\npoint of time Google listed on the US\nexchange was selling at\n$200 per share now it so happened that I\nI bought both stocks but at the time I\nthought that this was cheaper it would\ngo up even more whereas Google looked a\nbit expensive I was a bit\nuncertain but over a year later L&M from\nthree cents dropped to zero it went\nbankrupt and I lost all my money\nthankfully it was not a lot of money and\nGoogle which I also bought from $200\nwent up to $1,000 a share and contined\nto go up for the next couple of years in\nfact today Google before doing the share\nsplit of 20 to1 at today's price would\nbe worth 3,000\nuh $500 per share of course they did a\nshare split so now it's\n$178 share split so looking back I\nrealized that L&M at three cents was\nactually very expensive because the\nactual intrinsic value of L&M was\nactually close to zero because the\ncompany was losing a lot of money it was\non a verge of bankruptcy and at the same\ntime Google at $200 was really cheap\nbecause the intrinsic value was actually\nabout\n$600 of which the share price went above\nthat and then the intrinsic value Rose\nover time to now it's in fact a lot\nhigher in fact I can tell you right now\nGoogle is still the cheap so there are\ntwo major mistakes that retail investors\nmake in the markets mistake number one\nis looking at the absolute price and\nthinking that a low price means it's\ncheap and a high price means it's\nexpensive wrong instead you need to look\nat the in inic value of the stock which\nI'm going to explain in a while how I\ncalculate it and how I determine whether\nthe share price is above the intrinsic\nvalue expensive or below the intrinsic\nvalue cheap the second big mistake\ninvestors make is by looking at a very\nsimple metric like PE ratio to determine\nif a stock is cheap or expensive now I\nactually made a video just on this it's\ncalled the truth about PE ratios if if\nyou have not watched that video go watch\nthat video video after this video but\nlet me just summarize so PE ratio is a\nvery simple way to value a stock but it\ncan be often times very misleading\nbecause PE ratio doesn't take into\naccount the growth of the company and\ndoesn't take into account the cash flow\nor the free cash flow generated and only\nlooks at the net profit which sometimes\ncan be just an accounting entry that can\nbe very misleading so using PE ratio to\nvalue a stock is like guessing a\nperson's weight by looking at their\nShadow and it can be very misleading\nsometimes you see a big Shadow but a\nskinny person uh from a certain angle\nfor example a year and a half ago in\nJanuary 2022 Intel had a very low PE\nratio of about eight times earnings and\nNvidia had a PE ratio of 84 times\nearnings and so people who look at PE\nratio would have been misled they would\nhave thought hey this looks so cheap buy\nIntel right this so expensive don't buy\nNvidia short Nvidia if you had followed\nthe p ratio you would have made the\nworst mistake in your life because if\nyou actually do a proper valuation which\nI'm going to teach you how to do in a\nshort well you would find that at 8times\nPE intel was actually very\nexpensive why because the earnings were\nnot growing the earnings were declining\nand true enough if you bought it at $50\nat at time Intel would have dropped\nalmost by 50% down to about $30 today\nand if you bought Nvidia at a point of\ntime Nvidia was selling at $300 by the\nway I bought Nvidia at 150 right so I\nwas pretty lucky I bought it uh much\nlater than this actually but anyway even\nif you bought at 300 bucks today\nNvidia as of yesterday's close uh after\nhours is up to\n$1,000 per share because although P of\n84 times looks expensive but it was\nactually not that expensive because\nNvidia had huge growth potential so what\nis the meaning of intrinsic value and\nhow do we calculate it in the right way\nso first understand that when you buy a\nstock you are buying a piece of a\nbusiness so you got to know what the\nbusiness is worth and then divide it by\nthe number of shares to know what each\nshare is worth so what is a business\nworth now a business is actually a\nmoneymaking machine so the more money it\nmakes the more it is worth got it so how\ndo you know how much money this machine\nwill make so let me illustrate with an\nexample over\nhere let's imagine you have got a\nmoney-making machine and this is a\ntimeline I'm drawing this is\ntoday this is a year later this is two 2\nyears later this is 3 years later and\nlet's imagine that this machine will\nprint $100\ntoday right here right now so can you\ntell me how much this machine is worth\nif it prints $100\ntoday it's worth $100 right because if\nyou buy for $100 the machine gives you\n$100 you get back your money okay so the\nvalue of this machine this the intrinsic\nvalue is $100\nsimple enough enough what if I now told\nyou that if you bought this machine and\nthis machine would print $100 only\nin a year so one year from now you get\n$100 so what is this machine worth is it\nworth $100 no because you have to wait a\nyear to get that 100 bucks so it's worth\nless than 100 bucks if you were to buy\nthe machine today correct so what's the\nmachine worth today well it depends on\nthe opportunity cost of your money we\ncall this the discount rate so in other\nwords if you had the money to buy the\nmachine but you invested the money\nsomewhere else with the same risk what\nrate of return would you get so let's\nsay for argument sake if you put your\nmoney somewhere else you could get a\n5% return so that's your discount\nrate so what you then do is you take a\n$100 which you will get in a year you\ndivide it by 1 plus the discount rate 1\n+ 5% okay which is equal to 100 divide\nby 1.05 that gives you\n$95 taada so in other words this machine\nis worth\n$95 okay why because if you had $95\ntoday and you invest it at 5% you get\n$100 in a year's time next question what\nif I had a money-making machine that I\nbought today but it would print $100 in\ntwo years so you wait one year you wait\ntwo years and boom you get your1 $100\nwhat is this machine worth is it worth\n$100 no you could wait two years to get\nyour money so it's worth less than $100\nand worth less than 95 bucks\nso to get the answer you take a $100 and\ndivide it by again 1 plus the discount\nrate but you have to discount it twice\nto get to today's value so you got to\nsquare it okay so what is $100 divided\nby 1.05 squared you get\n$91 so money received in the future is\nworth less than money received today so\nwhatever money we get in the future we\nhave to discount it by a discount rate\nto the present value okay last question\nI promise so if I have a money-making\nmachine that I buy today that's going to\nprint\n$100 right now and then another 100 in a\nyear and another 100 in two years so I\nget 100 100 100 then what is this\nmachine worth today well this machine\nwill be worth $100\nplus\n95 plus\n91 so this machine the intrinsic value\nof the machine will be\n$286 per uh $286 right so what has this\ngot to do with investing in a stock of a\nbusiness same thing so for example when\nyou invest in shares of meta platforms\nwhich is a business you got to figure\nout in the next 10 20 years how much\ncash is the business going to generate\nand you take all that future cash and\nyou discount it to today's value divide\nby the number of shares and Tada you get\nthe intrinsic value of\nmattera and then you compare it to the\nshare price if the share price is above\nthat it's overv valued if it's below\nthat it is undervalued so how do I\nactually calculate the intrinsic value\nof the entire business of matter or\nRobin Hood and calculate the intrinsic\nvalue per share well I use this\nintrinsic value calculator that I\ndeveloped many many years ago and of\ncourse once you enroll in our value\nmomentum investing course you can\ndownload this calculator I'm going to\nshow you how I input the figures right\nnow so let's begin by valuing meta so\nwhat are we trying to do we're trying to\nfigure out how much cash meta will\ngenerate in the next 20 years it's like\nthe money-making machine generating cash\nfor the next 20 years and then\ndiscounting all that future cash flow to\nthe present value now if you study for a\nCFA in finance they teach you how to uh\nproject a business cash flow to\nperpetuity using a terminal value but I\ndon't do that I just assume the company\nwill make money for 20 years and die so\nanything more than 20 years it's a bonus\nso I'm being very conservative here so\nhow much money is meta making right now\nwell if you go on to Yahoo finance for\nexample you can see the last 12 months\nmeta generated\n49. 5.8 billion in free cash flow so\nwe're going to use that to project into\nthe future so let's put that in uh\n49 5\n18 million which is 49.5 one8 billion so\nthat is how much cash they are making in\none year all right so how much cash will\nthey make in the next 20 years so we\nwill project the growth rate over here\nnow what growth rate do we use that's\nthe tricky part if you go to a website\nlike finis you can see that they are\nprojecting\nmeta will be growing at about\n30% annually for the next 5 years 30%\ngrowth rate now I'm going to be really\nconservative and divide it by\nhalf it's always good to be conservative\nso I'm going to assume that mattera is\nonly going to grow at\n15% for the next 5 years and then after\nthat the following five years the growth\nwill slow down by half so what's half of\n15% 7.5%\nso that's the first 5 years of growth\nthe next 5 years and the last 10 years\nI'm just going to assume mattera is\ngoing to grow at 4% which is slightly\nabove the growth rate of the US economy\nokay so that's how I put in these very\nconservative growth rates then I've also\ngot to put in how much cash meta has on\ntheir balance sheet right now you can\ncheck that from the balance sheet\nthey've got $ 58 billion of cash\nthen I put in how much debt they have\nshort-term debt plus long-term debt from\nthe balance sheet they've got 18 billion\nin debt so I put in all these numbers\nover there and then I put in the number\nof shares that they have because what\nthis calculator does is it's going to\nproject all the future cash flow for the\nnext 20 years it's like the machine\nprinting money for the next 20 years and\nthen discounting everything everything\nto today's value value and divide it by\nthe number of shares to find out the\nintrinsic value per share now what\ndiscount rate do we use there are many\nmany uh ways to do it for example Warren\nBuffett uses the 10year treasury yield\nas his discount rate in a CFA cost\nthey'll teach you to use the weighted\naverage cost of capital but I use the\ncost of equity so using this table over\nhere I check the uh the B beta of meta\nis\n1.2 that measures the volatility of the\nstock and based on a 1.2 beta that gives\nme a discount rate of\n6.6% so I punched that in to the\ndiscount rate and it will give me the\nintrinsic value of mattera here there we\nare so the final intrinsic value is\n$532 as of yesterday's closing price\nmeta is selling at4\n$167 per share and you can see that at\n467 meta is still 12% under Valu it\nstill cheap so even though meta has gone\nup from $80 to 467 it's gone up let's\nsee it's gone\nup\n400% it's still cheap and that is why I\ncontinue to hold meta in my portfolio so\ndisclaimer that's right I'm still a\nshareholder of meta so I do have some\nvested interest right so you can see\nthis account I've got meta and I'm still\nholding it right here it's up about you\nknow\n$84,000 in in profits over there and uh\nthis other account meta is up uh\n$888,000 in profits actually I'm up a\nlot more than that but I was stupid\nenough to sell some covered calls on\nmeta so some of my shares got taken away\ndamn it right but I still have a couple\nof shares left which is not too bad I've\ngot about\nI still have about let's see\n$186,000 worth of meta shares in this\naccount and\nanother\n88,000 worth of meta shares in my second\naccount so total is about 370,000 worth\nof meta shares which is okay a decent\nposition now how about Robin Hood so\nRobin Hood looks really cheap based on\nits absolute price because it's now\ntrading at you know\n$19.66 and some people may say well it\nwas at $84 Once Upon a Time looks really\ncheap could it get back up there now do\nbear in mind that in a short term market\nprices are driven purely by emotions and\nmanipulation so even a business that has\ngot no intrinsic value that is uh losing\nmoney going to die the share price can\ngo up because of hype and manipulation\nbecause of some pussycat or like you\nknow Donald Trump's Media Company where\nthey're losing so much money the share\nprice could go up purely based on\nmanipulation but it is not sustainable\nso as an investor if you're looking to\ninvest for the long run to build your\nwealth then you don't want the price to\njust go up in the short term based on\nhype you want it to go up and keep going\nup in the long run all right so that's\nwhen intrinsic value comes into play so\nwould I buy Robin Hood At today's share\nprice not that I think the hype is going\nto drive up but I think it's worth $119\nwell let's do a valuation so the first\nthing to do is to take a look at how\nmuch cash Robin Hood is making right now\nand then we project it to the next 20\nyears and discount it to present value\nso going to Yahoo finance you can see\nthat for Robin Hood it's actually losing\nmoney for the last 12 months they\nactually had a negative free cash flow\nof\n$295\nmillion and um so what what happens I\nmean it's negative we can't put in a\nnegative figure right and you can see\ntheir free cash flow is very\ninconsistent in 2020 it was you know\n1 uh 8 billion and then it was minus\n968 million uh then it was minus 900\nmillion then it was 1.16 billion so it's\nlike it's it's like all over the shop\nright they make money they lose money\nthey make money they lose money right so\nwhat do you do in a situation like that\nso personally the way I would value it\nin such situation is to take the average\nfree cash flow over the last three or\nfive years so if you take the average of\nThe Last 5 Years at all the five years\ntogether and divide by five you get an\naverage free cash flow\nof\n66.4\nmillion okay1 66.4 million so if we\npunch that into the intrinsic value\ncalculator 16\n6.4 million okay and Robin Hood has\ntotal debt of\n4.2 billion in debt they've got 4.7\nbillion in cash now how about the growth\nof the company what is the growth rate\nwell if you go to uh various websites\nyou notice there's no projected growth\nrate because the company is so\ninconsistent there are no analyst that\ncan make a decent projection for example\nif you go to finis you can see that the\nnext uh 5 years sorry that's mattera\nlet's go to Robin Hood the next 5 years\nthe projection is undefined right but\nthey are projected to grow at\n5.97% next year they can only project\none year but beyond that they say we\nhave got no freaking clue okay and if\nyou go to another website Guru Focus you\ncan see again they usually give a future\ngrowth rate undefined so we have no idea\nwhat the growth rate is so inconsistent\nso the only thing I can do is to put in\nthe future Revenue growth rate which uh\nin this website they Define it as\n17.6% so being very optimistic let's use\n17.6% in the growth rate so if we punch\nin\n17.6% and let's assume they can grow at\n17.6% for the next 10 years right let's\nput that in and even with a 177% growth\nrate uh their intrinsic value comes up\nto only\n$7 so at today's share price of\n$19 it is way overpriced it's overpriced\nbut by1 71% and that is why I believe\nthat Robin Hood is actually expensive at\ntoday's price and meta is actually cheap\nat today's price now that does not mean\nthat I can predict that mattera will go\nup the next day the next week or the\nnext next month and Robin Hood is going\nto go down the next day the next week\nthe next month no remember in the short\nterm anything can happen in the short\nterm the market is driven by news\nemotions and manipulation so sure Robin\nHood could go up in the short term meta\ncould go down in the long term but in\nthe long run I rather hold mattera which\nI know is undervalued now than holding\nRobin Hood over the long run so I do\nhope you have found this video\nenlightening and if you have do gives a\nthumbs up so thank you for watching and\nas always me the markets be with
