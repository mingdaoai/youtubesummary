{"transcript": "Hey guys. So, after testing out every single LLC formation service that I could possibly find as of 2025 anyway, there's only three that I can actually recommend based off of my experience testing them out. And yeah, there's definitely one out of the three that to me stands out as the best is the one I personally use. I'll get into why a little bit later in the video, but I'm going to break down everything as far as the three services I'm going to talk about. I'm going to tell you what I liked. I'm going to tell you what bugged me. And I'm going to tell you, of course, like I said before, which one I personally use, and you can decide which one's the best for you. There are links down below for each one that I'm going to mention that will help you get more information on them as well as give you their best pricing if you use those links to sign up. All right, now let's get right to the punch line. My number one choice is Northwest Registered Agent. It's still my number one pick as of 2025 and it it still is what I personally use. I've tested so many services now and every single time I end up comparing it back to back to Northwest. It's kind of the only one where I didn't feel like I was immediately being shoved into a salesunnel. Now, let me break down what you get with them. So, they have a $39 plan. Of course, the $39 doesn't include state fees. You still have to pay those, but it's going to include number one, business formation. They're also going to give you one free year of registered agent service. After that year, you will have to pay for it. You're also going to get privacy protection, actual privacy protection. For example, they actually use their address, not yours, which is a big deal. And of course, an operating agreement and startup documents. And what I like about them, guys, is there's no spammy upsells. There's no hidden fees they're going to hit you with later. And they also have a $225 full service package that includes a little bit more. Okay, so that one's going to include EIN filing, same day processing. It's also going to include premium business docs and customer support, guys. That actually feels like a real person helping you because it is like the customer service is literally literally gold. You're actually speaking to a US-based English speaker. Thank God for that. Okay. No scripts, no, you know, precon pre-constructed responses to your issues, no hold for 45 minutes. just actual help when you need it. And over time, I've actually started using more of their features. For example, things like mail forwarding, compliance reminders, and even getting a second LLC set up by them. Why? Because it just works. It's quiet. It's clean. They're very reliable. And if you're someone who doesn't want drama with all of your formation or legal stuff, this is the one I definitely recommend. Now, there's also Zen Business, which is, for me anyway, a pretty close second for the simple fact of their simplicity. Now, if you want to consider like Northwest a quiet professional, Zen Business is like a like like a friendly tour guide. Everything's polished, really easy to navigate, and it's really designed for beginners. If you've never set up a business before, this platform will walk you through it the entire process step by step. They make it really easy. They have a plan that's $199. It's called their pro plan and it includes LLC formation, EIN number. It's also going to include an operating agreement and annual report reminders and filing. They call it worry-free compliance. And it really is uh worry-free because you don't have to like worry about, you know, putting it in your calendar. They will reach out to you to remind you of these things. They also offer a $0 starter plan. But heads up, that version comes with a lot of add-ons and a lot of upsells. So unless you're really laser focused on just skipping all the extra fluff, your final cost is probably going to be higher than you end up thinking it's going to be. Now, they also have a subscription model. I'll be honest, for some people this is perfect. You do pay monthly. Everything is bundled, though, and it just keeps you on track easily. For me though, I ended up turning off a bunch of features that I didn't want, and I I just I got annoyed by having to constantly opt out of stuff. It felt like more work than than it really should have been. Still a really solid company, reliable, just not the one that I personally stuck with. Now, my third choice is Busy. Definitely my least favorite on the list, but they still made the list for a reason. They were formerly called Inkfile. Um, this is the best one for tight budgets. Now, here's the thing. It's free, or at least the base version is. They have a 0 plan that gives you, I'm not going to lie, it gives you a couple really good things. It gives you business formation. It's also going to give you one year of registered agent service. It's uh also going to offer you an online dashboard access and some basic alerts and reminders that you're going to want at least upfront in the beginning. Now, it is a super attractive offer if you're just trying to get things done with as little upfront cost as possible. But you know that expression, you get what you pay for. It really shows up in this example. The support, it's not that great. The dashboard, it's really messy and they hit you with upsells like you wouldn't believe. For example, you want an EIN, that's extra. you want an operating agreement that's also going to cost you extra. It It makes you feel like you're being charged at McDonald's for extra pickles and ketchup on your burger, which was It just feels ridiculous. Now, it's not the worst, which is why it's on my list. It gets the job done, but it just feels like a starter tool, not something you really want to build on long term. Now, again, Northwest is my top choice here, and there are links below again for whichever you choose. Okay, see you in the next video.", "language": "en", "title": "Best Registered Agent Service in 2025 (I Tested Them ALL)"}
