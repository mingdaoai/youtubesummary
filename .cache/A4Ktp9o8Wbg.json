{"transcript": "Sora 2 just launched. It is free and it\nis absolutely insane. I got my hands on\nit and I already made these Sam Alburn\nmemes.\n>> Is that Sam?\n>> Why is he dressed like a cat?\n>> I have no idea.\n>> Is this some kind of experiment?\n>> He looks serious.\n>> You good, Sam?\n>> GPUs. More GPUs. GPUs. GPUs.\n>> You heard them.\n>> Jensen, deliver the GPU now.\n>> And as you can see, we finally have\naudio on Sora. We have Cameo and we have\na bunch of other things inside of this\ntool. Now, I will show you how to get\naccess for free, even if you're in\nEurope like me, like I'm in the\nNetherlands and I still got access. And\nI will show you how it all works. So,\nlet's dive straight into it. So, this is\nthe Sora 2 platform and we got this on\nthe mobile app on iOS and on desktop.\nFrom the looks of it, it is similar to\nhow Tik Tok works. Like, this is\nsomewhat of a AI slop feed. And I don't\nknow what Sam Alman has done, but yeah,\nit is absolutely insane. So, I will link\nthis website in the description down\nbelow. Now, if you want to get access,\nthen you need to get an invite code, but\nfirst, if you're not from the USA or\nCanada, then you need to use a VPN in\norder to access this site. So, what I'm\nusing is NVPN. I will leave a link to\nthat in the description down below so\nyou can try this out yourself. A premium\nVPN works best with this. So, after\nyou've connected to the United States,\nlike I am right here, you can then\naccess the Sora website. The next thing\nyou want to do is you want to enter in\nyour invite code. I will add in my\ninvite code right here. Be there quick\nbecause I only have four of them.\n>> I just need one invite. Somebody share\nthe code.\n>> Look, I've got everything open. Just let\nme in.\n>> Please, I want access so bad.\n>> Me, too. I'm ready right now.\n>> Send us the invite code. Now, if you're\ntoo late, I would urge you to go over to\nthe OpenAI Discord and go over to the\nstore to tap here. People are sharing\ntheir invite code. Sometimes this\ndoesn't work. Like for example, this\none, four of them are pressing the X\nbutton and one of them is happy. So,\nliterally, you got to kind of like\nstream snipe this page right here and\nthen hope for the best. I also want to\ntell you in the comments down below, if\nyou got in, please share your codes in\nthe comments down below so everyone else\ncan get access. Everyone gets up to like\nfour invites once you're into the\nplatform. So now that you got access to\nSor 2, let me just explain how this\nplatform works. And yeah, the AI slop\nalready has been crazy. So let's just go\nover this feed. So we got Sam Alman\nright here. My precious GPUs. Yes,\nprecious. We love them. We does so many\ncores so fast. Nobody else gets them.\nNo, my precious. Oh, look at them. The\nlittle boards, the fans, sweet and cold.\nMy precious GPUs. Yes, precious. We love\nthem. We does so many cores. I honestly\nI don't know what Sam Alman has done to\nhimself. Like he has turned himself into\nthe biggest meme. So you can see what\nother people have created and posted. I\nhave done a few posts myself. Let me\njust show you a few that I made. So here\nI have this one.\nOh, cute. You got V3. That's adorable.\nWe got Sora, too.\nYeah. So that's just one of the things\nyou can do. Here we got another one that\nis the current situation within this\nDiscord community.\n>> Somebody share the code.\n>> Look, I've got everything open. Just let\nme in.\n>> Please, I want access so bad.\n>> Me, too. I'm ready right now.\n>> Send us the invite code.\n>> The way this works is you can generate\nyour video. So, in this generation bar\nand then you can add a cameo. You can\nadd in cameos of yourself by using the\niOS app. And if you are from Europe, you\nneed to get access to a USA Apple ID in\norder to download that app. I currently\ndon't have that. I only have this\navailable on my phone right now, but\nafter this video, trust me, I'm going to\nget access soon by changing my location\nto USA. So then you can select the\ncharacter or the cameo that you want to\nuse. So in this case, we do Sam Alman.\nAnd then you can type in your prompt.\nYou can switch between landscape and\nportrait. And you can add in your own\nfootage. So, if you have any meme, any\ntype of video where you want to do\nsomething with it, you can upload it in\nhere and it will help you generate a\nvideo. Now, the cameos are surprisingly\ngood. Like, I've generated a bunch of\ndifferent videos mimicking Sam Alman.\n>> Everyone, this is a little surreal, but\nI feel honored and I brought gifts, free\nSO2 codes. They're inside. Help\nyourselves.\n>> That's amazing.\n>> Honestly, it's insane. Like, look at\nthis one.\n>> Is that Sam?\n>> Why is he dressed like a cat?\n>> I have no idea. Is this some kind of\nexperiment? He looks serious.\n>> Uh, you good, Sam?\n>> Yeah, I'm having way too much fun with\nthis. Here's another one.\n>> I will take millions of jobs. What will\nyou do?\n>> Maybe just sit back and watch.\n>> The other thing I must note from testing\nthis out so far is that they are trying\nto compete with Instagram and Tik Tok.\n>> Time. I'm fighting back. Tik Tok,\nInstagram, the endless scroll. They've\nhad their turn. Meet Sora 2. My feed, my\nrules.\n>> Powered by adaptive AI. The noise just\n>> literally this whole app is meant as a\nAI slop social media feed. Like look at\nmy bio. Like you can follow me right now\nif you search on Danke then you will\nfind my account and you can watch my AI\nslop on my account. So make sure to\nfollow me there. But yeah, I already\nhave six followers, six likes. So that\nmeans that this like becomes a new\nplatform that if you want to scroll, you\nmight use Sora for this. Honestly, I'm\nnot sure where that is going, but it\nlooks interesting. So, if you want to\nbecome AI famous, then this might be the\nplatform that you need to jump on fast.\nOther than that, it has a few issues so\nfar. So, I've tried creating a few\ndifferent things and I got censored a\nfew times. So, for example, right here,\nI had this prompt, Will Smith eating a\nbowl of spaghetti. Unfortunately, that\nviolated the content policy because\nusing someone else's face without\npermission is violating their agreement.\nOther things that don't work is using\nany character from like Star Wars\nmovies. I tried it here with Darth\nVader. But strangely enough, doing this\nwith Pikachu does still work. So, if we\ntake a look at their prompt, it's\nliterally Pikachu doing ASMR, and he's\ndoing a remix of other videos. So,\nthat's a possibility, too. To do a\nremix, the way it works is you click on\nremix right here. And now you can type\nin your own prompt. So now we're going\nto say Pikachu\nsaying pika pika. So now we can say\nPikachu saying pika pika. Then it is\nregenerating that same video but with\nyour own new prompt onto it. So it's\nliterally like remixing like the name\nsays. You can also comment on it. So we\nhave like comments, likes, and people\nare going crazy on this. Now it seems to\nwork quite well with other characters\ntoo with South Park, Spongebob, Rick and\nMorty as well. And we got Minecraft.\nHonestly, I have no idea how they're\ngoing to get away with this if there\nwill be more censoring or if there's\ngoing to be a massive lawsuit for OpenAI\nor if they can just use this. Now, to\nhelp out the community, if you want to\nshare your invite codes, then please\nleave them in the comments down below. I\nalready have shared mine, too, but\nthere's a massive demand for them. And\nif you want to be one of the first to\naccess this, if you're outside of the\nUSA and Canada, then you need to use a\nVPN like NVPN. I will leave the link to\nthat in the description down below.
