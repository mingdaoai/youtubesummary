{"transcript": "If you've been on the internet, you've\nseen Danco. He's got millions of\nfollowers and I've seen him everywhere.\nSo, I reached out to him and I was like,\n\"How do you do it?\" And he told me that\nhis secret is LLM's, AI, and prompts.\nSo, in this episode, he shows his exact\nplaybook for coming up with ideas,\ncreating the content, and most\nimportantly, content that is going to go\nviral. Now, why I find this interesting\nis right now there's an unfair advantage\nto create X accounts, to create YouTube\nchannels that get distribution. If you\ncan figure out distribution, you could\ncreate a bunch of startups for those\naudiences. So, if you stick around to\nthis end of this episode, you will\nunderstand how to create content like\nDanco. And, you know, people generally\ncharge thousands of dollars for this.\nIt's free. All I ask is for a like and a\ncomment on this episode. I can't wait to\nsee what you build. Have a creative day.\nWhat's up, Dan? Great to have you. By\nthe end of this episode, what are people\ngoing to take out of it? Glad to be\nhere, dude. Thank you for having me on.\nUh, I have a few things to share, but\nthe outcome as a whole will be a big\npicture overview of my content\necosystem. So before we just started,\nyou were mentioning like uh you're\ncurious about how my output is so high\nwhen I personally don't think it's that\nhigh. It doesn't take too much. So uh I\nthink it just comes down to having a\nreally smart system and then being able\nto augment that with AI in a unique way,\nwhich we're going to learn. But the\nother thing that we have to learn in\norder to do that well is just how to use\nLLMs in a way to get them to do exactly\nwhat you want. So I'm not a coder. I\ndon't use too many of the fancy tools.\nMostly just claw chat GPT. So how are we\ngoing to use the base tools that most\npeople have access to and understand to\ncreate something incredible?\nI love it. I only have one ask from you.\nYou know, I just ask that you don't hold\nback any sauce. You give the prompts.\nYou show how it's really done. Because\nwhat would be success for me is if\nthousands of people consume this episode\nand understand how to use LLMs to be\nlike you. Because when I see Dan Co, I\nsee millions of followers. I see you\neverywhere. I see content here. I see\ncontent there. And I'm like, how does\nthis guy do it? Dan, can you commit to\nit?\nAbsolutely. Yep.\nAll right, let's get into it.\nCool. Uh, so the first thing there, just\nto touch on, uh, millions of followers,\nhaving so much content on so many\ndifferent platforms. The the thing about\nthat is all of my content is a same is\nthe same across all different platforms.\nSo the base of it all comes down to two\nthings. It comes down to my newsletter,\nwhich I write every week, sometimes\ntwice a week, but once a week is like\nbaseline. And then two is two to three\nsocial media posts a day and those are\nusually written. And so I write Twitter\nfirst because it's like the 28 280\ncharacter limit. And then since that's\nlike the limiting factor out of all the\nplatforms that can pretty easily\ntransfer over to any other platform. So\nthat gets posted to threads by\nInstagram. I turn that into an image and\npost that onto LinkedIn onto Instagram.\nSometimes I use them as a real script.\nSo I pull up my camera, look at my\nphone, read my best tweet, recite it to\nthe camera, maybe add a bit on there.\nUm, and then I have reals, Tik Toks,\nshorts, etc. And the good thing about\nthat is since the ideas themselves are\nalmost always validated ideas or have\nthe potential to do very well, if I can\nnail the first idea that goes out on\nTwitter, then I'm practically nailing\nall the other content that goes out on\nall other platforms because I'm not much\nof a trend follower. Sometimes I am, but\nmost of the time I believe that the\nalgorithms are based off of human\npsychology. And if you understand human\npsychology and can use AI to help you\nunderstand that more, your content will\nsee a notable increase in engagement and\nother things of that nature. So, uh,\nfirst I'll just give an overview in this\ncanvas style so you understand my weekly\nprocess. So, every week I plan out my\nnewsletter and the idea for the\nnewsletter.\nIt's based on\na a few different things. It could be a\ntop performing tweet of mine that I had\nbefore because I know that that tweet\nhas already done well. So, I'm just\ngoing to take on it take it expand it\ninto a newsletter that turns into a\nYouTube video podcast. Good to go.\nuh or it can be based on a video that is\nalready doing well on YouTube. So a good\nway to generate ideas that help you grow\nis to go to YouTube, look at the\naccounts in your niche or the people the\nkind of like tribe you want to join\nonline. Go to their account, go to\nvideos, filter by most popular, and then\njust write down 10 of the videos that\nyou think you could recreate. Now, the\nsecret there is you're not watching the\nvideos. You're not trying to steal\nanything from the video itself. You're\ntrying to take the topic, the angle, and\nwrite your own perspective on it.\nBecause if other people are watching\nthose videos since they have a lot of\nviews, then they're going to just by the\nnature of YouTube and people binge\nwatching things, they're going to be\nrecommended your video. They're going to\nwatch that. And if they hear you say the\nsame things as the other person, then\nyou're not going to stand out or be\nunique. So that's what this process is.\nSo that's usually the two ways that I\ncome up with newsletter ideas. And I\nkeep a document where I tend to I just\nhave a list of ideas that I can pull\nfrom. I pick the one that I think is\ngoing to do the best that week. Now what\nI do for that is I of course have a\nplace where I write the newsletter just\nin a note or document. But I tend to\nfind a few things that I've either\ntalked about before relating to that. So\nprevious newsletters, previous tweets,\nwhatever they may be. And then Sam\nAlman, the co-founder of OpenAI just\nsaid that it is the era of the idea guy.\nAnd he is not wrong. I think that right\nnow is an incredible time to be building\na startup. And if you listen to this\npodcast, chances are you think so, too.\nNow, I think that you can look at trends\nuh to basically figure out uh what are\nthe startup ideas you should be\nbuilding. So, that's exactly why I built\nideabser.com. Every single day, you're\ngoing to get a free startup idea in your\ninbox, and it's all backed by high\nquality data trends. How we do it,\npeople always ask. We use AI agents to\ngo and search what are people looking\nfor and what are they screaming for in\nterms of products that you should be\nbuilding and then we hand it on a you\nknow silver platter for you to go check\nout. Um we do have a few paid plans that\nyou know take it to the next level uh\ngive you more ideas give you more AI\nagents and more almost like a chat GBT\nfor ideas with it but you can start for\nfree ideabrowser.com and if you're\nlistening to this I highly recommend it.\nA lot of the times I like to weave in\nother concepts from specific books or\nvideos. So this is where AI really comes\ninto play because I'm talking about\nuh survival and how to reinvent yourself\nin this newsletter. And when I say\nsurvival, I'm talking about\npsychological survival, something that I\nfind really unique and interesting. And\nI've previously watched three videos on\nthat. They're each by a channel called\nactualize.org\nand they're like three hours long. So,\nit's a lot of learning when I'm on walks\nand other things of that nature that\nallows me to write in-depth newsletters,\nbut I'm usually not taking notes during\nthis time. And this is where LLMs can\ncome into play because they can usually\npull from YouTube videos or PDFs\nallowing you to talk to them and pull up\nthe relevant points that you want to\ntalk about in a newsletter. So the\nresearch process there is thinking about\nthe newsletter and the topic I want to\nwrite, talking with AI a bit and just\ngetting specific key points and\nsummaries and uh other unique\nperspectives and maybe throwing in a few\nthings about the topic that I'm talking\nabout just so I have a chat that I can\nrefer to that\nturns 6 hours of videos into a thousand\nwords, right? So then I can write about\nit myself.\nUh now the other thing here is if I bake\nin something I've written previously. So\nthis is on reinventing yourself. It's\nkind of my thoughts on that. So you can\nthink of this newsletter as like\ncombining these two. So when I\ntake the summary, paste it into another\nchat or link it to another chat, then I\ncan say, okay, what are the similarities\nhere? Is there anything that I'm\nmissing? I'm kind of just in this\nprocess of ideiation with the LLM until\nI feel like I have enough firepower to\nstart piecing together an outline and\nthen to start writing it. Now, I don't\nhave the LLM write for me, like the\nactual newsletter. Um, but with what\nwe're going to talk about,\nyou could technically do that. And if we\nhave time, I'll actually show you how to\ndo that specifically. But uh that's the\nresearch process. Nothing special here.\nJust getting information from the\ngetting the ideas so that I can put them\ninto the newsletter. Otherwise, you just\nget stuck staring at a blank screen.\nSo I have a question on this. So what\nyour thesis is basically you use X\nTwitter as a litmus test on ideas.\nYes. And then once you have an idea that\ngets validated,\nthen you're like, okay, this might have\nlegs to extend this to other mediums.\nThen you\nlook to YouTube as a encyclopedia of\nknowledge. you find popular videos\num or or videos that just are high\nquality that you know might be you know\nmight be it might be hours long and then\nyou use looks like you use Gemini in the\nfirst example to summarize it. You can\nuse you know really anything you want,\nright?\nYeah, I I tend to go with Gemini 2.5,\nespecially when there's Oh, this one's\nonly 9 minutes, but for like the three\nto six hour videos, I'll use Gemini just\nbecause the large context window,\nright? So, you get smart about the\nvideos and then from that you you extend\nit, right? And you're you're not using\nthe LMS to at this point write it. But\num I guess my question is cuz someone\nsomeone listening this is going to be\nlike\nokay but you never talked about the\nhardest part which is your great ideas\non Twitter. You know what I mean?\nSo\nhow do you think about that?\nSo it's kind of circular, right? The\nideas for Twitter can come from two\ndifferent places. It can come from the\nnewsletter itself. So I'll show over\nhere in a second, but they can come from\nthe newsletter itself and that's a good\nway to generate ideas. But the mistake\nthat people make there is they'll have a\nreally good newsletter and they'll\nthink, \"Okay, I'm supposed I'm supposed\nto pull ideas from this and they'll read\na certain sentence or paragraph and just\ntry to copy paste that directly and post\nit on Twitter with a maybe a few changes\nwhen\nin reality what you're looking for is\njust the idea that you can turn into a\nhigh performing tweet. So,\nit's kind of the same thing there where\nthe first step is learning how to write\nhigh performing tweets. And there's\ncourses on there. There's courses on\nthis. There's YouTube videos on this.\nThe best thing I can recommend is\nactually what I'm going to show you, but\nyou need to kind of immerse yourself in\ngood writing and ideas. I think the best\nthing you can do to write better social\ncontent in general is to just keep a\nswipe file of really good ideas that\nyou'd like to emulate under your own\nbrand. I think of brand as the ideas\nthat you associate yourself with. And so\nyou're not necessarily copying other\npeople's ideas or taking other people's\nideas. You're synthesizing a bunch of\ndifferent ideas that are technically\nwhat compose your mind and your\nworldview and you're bringing them\ntogether in a very articulate way under\nyour own brand and then as people\nconsume those over time\nyou gain that authority in their head.\nSo uh that's one way to come up with\nideas is just keep a swipe file. You\nhave to become like a ruthless notetaker\nand just consistently save ideas until\nit's until you've read so many of them\nand written so many of them that it's\nbecome second nature to you on how to\njust structure an idea. Like you can\ngive me a word and then if you give me a\nminute to think about it, I could\nprobably come up with a really good post\nabout that thing.\nAnd do you use any tools for that?\nUm, I use, if we go to Twitter,\nso I've used both Tweet Hunter X and\nSuperX. It It feels like\na lot of people or no company has really\nmastered this yet, just the Twitter\nsidebar in general, where when you go to\na certain person's profile, this is the\nSuper X extension, and it just shows\ntheir top performing tweets. So if you\nwrite down five to 10 accounts that you\nreally like uh and you kind of want to\nI think you refine your writing style by\nreading the writing you aspire to have.\nAnd so if you have the accounts that\ntalk like you want to talk and you\nconsistently visit their highest\nperforming tweets with SuperX or Tweet\nHunterX and save all of these down and\ntry to exchange either the structure or\nthe idea and practice posting. What I\nmean by that is right here there's a\nclear structure. Go on more walks, walk\nfor no reason, walk to solve a problem,\netc., etc. You can take this structure\nor bring another idea into it. So rather\nthan walks it could be\ncode\ncode more code every day something of\nthat nature. And then the more you or\nthat's\nexchanging the taking the structure and\nexchanging the idea from it. But you can\nalso take an idea like go on more walks\nand exchange the structure of it. So\nthen you look at another structure where\nthis is just a single sentence\nuh\nI don't know platitude of sorts this one\nat least and you can just take the idea\nof walks try to write it as a single\nsentence now you have two tweets from\none idea. Um, and the more you do that\nand practice it, then really any idea\nhas the potential to do very well cuz\nyou can just pop it into a pre-existing\nstructure or you can take a structure\nand plug in one of the ideas that you're\ntrying to include in your brand. So, uh,\none thing there that I'll talk on and\nthen we'll get into actually doing all\nof that. Uh what the after I write the\nnewsletter, I have three prompts that I\nlike to run it through. So this first\none is just a YouTube title generator.\nAnd I'll show you how this one's\nstructured. And if you do this, Greg, I\ncan uh put all of these in a Google doc\nso people can copy paste them and read\nthrough them and dissect how they're\nstructured. But for this prompt\nspecifically, I uh wrote a prompt. I\ntook my best like 15 titles on YouTube\nand I\nwhatever I plug into it, the newsletter\nI plug into it, it pulls out the key\npoints from that newsletter and tries to\nspin them into uh 20 to 30 YouTube\ntitles that are similar and follow the\nsame psychological patterns and\nprinciples as my best performing titles.\nAnd so it spits these out here and then\nI tend to read through these, cross out\nones that I don't think would work,\nhighlight ones that I think would\npotentially come up with a better one\nfrom my own mind, test that out on\nYouTube. If it doesn't work after 2\nweeks, I'll try changing the title.\nUsually that'll get it to a decent place\nin terms of views. And the reason I\ncreate YouTube titles for this is\nbecause\nmy newsletter is a practically an\noutline for my YouTube videos, right? I\nhave it pulled up as I'm looking at the\nscreen, I mean at the camera. I'll look\ndown, read a sentence, recite it to the\ncamera. Sometimes I'll riff. Sometimes\nI'll read straight from it. uh if I'm\nlooking down and reading at the\nnewsletter, my editor just adds B-roll\nor text screens over my face so people\ncan't see me looking down. But that's\nthe general structure of it and people\nquite like it. The objection there\nusually is\nuh well, if you're posting the same\nthing on two platforms, won't people\nnotice that or won't they get bored?\nRight?\nAnd most of the time, I've seen the\nopposite. Like there are people that\nread it and then when they watch or\nlisten to it, they get something\nentirely new because it's a different\nmedium. Other people prefer to watch or\nlisten rather than read. And I I just\nfeel like my philosophy behind it is I'd\nrather produce one amazing thing a week\nand just put all of my attention into\nthat and put it out across all platforms\nrather than try to create something new\nfor each platform and each of those\nthings not be as good. And there's\nprobably marginal difference between the\ntwo paths, but I've really gotten into\nthis flow of the weekly flow of\nnewsletter, YouTube video, social posts\nacross all platforms, and it's worked\nout pretty well. People don't get angry,\nand it's seems like it's working.\nBut the next thing I do is I'll take the\nnewsletter or the YouTube video and I'll\nplug them into a deep post generator\nprompt and just a content ideas\ngenerator. And these are both kind of\nthe same thing. For the deep post\ngenerator, I wrote a prompt that\nbreaks it breaks down the newsletter or\nwhatever you feed it. It could be a PDF,\na YouTube video, anything. And\nI came up with this prompt. It's still\nkind of fuzzy how I did it because it\nwas like a huge conversation, but I\nbroke down I asked it to break down a\nbunch of these social posts that I\nreally liked. Uh the way they were\nstructured, the way they were written,\nand the key things that made them do\nreally well. And after that\nconversation, it said, \"Okay, well, a\nlot of these have paradoxes and\ncounterintuitive truths. A lot of them\nhave a transformation arc. A lot of them\nhave core problems. Uh, a lot of them\nhave examples or they handle objections\nor they have action steps or\naspirational statements.\" And so I was\nlike, \"Okay, take each one of these and\nuh\nbreak down the newsletter, whatever\nyou're fed, into like five compelling\npost ideas, like the most impactful\nideas that could be turned into posts.\nAnd then I want you to ideulate three\ncore paradoxes, a bunch of key quotes,\ntransformation arc, core problems, key\nexamples.\" So with this, I'm not asking\nit to write tweets for me because the\nLLM isn't going to be too good at doing\nthat unless you guide it to in a very\nspecific way. But instead here is I have\nit give me the pieces of ideas like the\nthe\ndeconstruction\nof high-erforming content and ideas and\njust give me a bunch of those. And so I\ncan read through here and when one thing\nsparks an idea for me, boom, I can go\nand start writing a tweet on that. Or I\ncan combine a bunch of these together\nsince technically\neach of these like all of these\nparadoxes, quotes, problems are all\nrelated. They're all about one idea. So\nI just have a bunch of building blocks\nfor good content in here.\nThe next prompt that I use is just a\ngeneral content idea generation. And I\nhave it give me 60 ideas. And these are\nusually based around the tweets that\nhave done really well for me or the\nsocial post in general. I found that\npeople really like when I give harsh\nlife advice and I like that too. Uh\ncounterintuitive truths which is very\nsimilar to the paradoxes.\ncore problems or pain points. Again,\nvery similar key insights, wisdom, big\nideas. So, I can just read through here\nand I'm not technically I'm not trying\nto copy paste these as a tweet. I'm just\ntrying to generate a starting point for\nan idea so that I can\nhave those ideas faster, right? because\nI feel like good ideas are the fuel for\ncontent, but usually good ideas come\nfrom sifting through hours of YouTube\nvideos on a walk or reading a good book\nor uh read finding a really good\nSubstack article and having that\ngenerate ideas or just sitting and\nthinking with your thoughts until\nsomething emerges. And those are great\nways to come up with ideas, but this is\njust a way to kind of force that to an\nextent and still maintain the quality\nwithout having the LLM actually write it\nfor you. Now, so we just went over like\nin general how I go over or how I create\nmy newsletters and content each week.\nThat's just the writing ideiation\nprocess. How I actually structure that\non a day-to-day basis is quite simple\nwhere I wake up, do a little morning\nroutine, shower, walk, whatever it may\nbe, and then I sit down at my computer\nand the next two hours is just dedicated\nto writing. So in that writing, I have\nto finish one section of my newsletter\nand I have to finish three posts, three\nsocial posts. And then within that time,\nyou usually have time within that two\nhours still to paste those social posts\nto all platforms or at least schedule\nthem. And so that's kind of my routine\nevery day. It's just 2 hours of writing.\nAnd that's the base of all of my social\nmedia, all of my newsletter. Uh, one day\nout of the week, I record my YouTube\nvideo and pass that off to the editor.\nAnd then boom, my content is done.\nAnd the rest is history. You got\nmillions, millions of followers,\nmillions of likes.\nWell, that that was the other thing that\nI\nfound relatively quick is\nonce I had a post that started to\ngenerate more followers than other ones\ndid, I knew that I just had to start\ncreating spin-offs of that post because\nthen it's like\nI almost had a predictable way to\nincrease the follower growth. So, it's\nlike the the key part here is one, you\nneed to experiment until you kind of\nstrike gold and know what brings in\nfollowers. Then you need to make that a\nconsistent part of your process and\nconsistently create spin-offs of that\nwhile with your other time. And let's\nsay that's 30% of the time. That's like\none post a day out of the three. The\nother two posts are for continuing the\nexperimentation on until you find the\nnext one that is like you striking gold.\nThen you make that a part of your\nprocess. Now you have two posts a day\nthat are just consistently most like\nthey they're not all going to bring in a\nton of followers, but you're getting\ncloser and closer to just consistently\nincreasing followers over time by doing\nthis. And if you keep that balance of\nyour core ideas that are consistently\ngoing to bring in followers with a\nhealthy dose of experimentation until\nyou find more and then you just cycle\nout the core ideas. That's really the\nentire growth process on any social\nplatform in my opinion.\nSo there's there's one thing that's\nmissing from this which is visual assets\nlike media. So on X, I've noticed that\nlike if I tweet just words versus I\ntweet words with an image, the words\nwith image, you know, call it performs\n40% better.\nUm, and so how do you think about that?\nHow do you think, you know, okay, you do\nthis process to come up with ideas to\nwrite the content, but what do you do\nabout the image?\nI don't do anything. But but that's just\nme. Um because I've ever since I started\nout, I kind of put the constraint on\nmyself of like I want to do this with\njust writing. I I didn't start YouTube\nuntil I think 2 years after I was on\nTwitter. And\nju just by creating that constraint, it\nmade me be more creative and I think it\nmade me refine my writing a lot more.\nI've occasionally incorporated visuals\nin my Instagram posts uh and newsletters\nfor like drawing out specific concepts\nor having certain infographics or I even\ndid animations on Instagram at one point\nand those things definitely helped but\nuh the animations eventually died down\nbecause a lot more people started doing\nthem. And then same with the visuals.\nLike I noticed they were a good pattern\ninterrupt when I would post those after\nnot posting them for a while and they\nwould get a lot more engagement. But\nthen if I tried to make that a\nconsistent thing, they would just\nbalance out as most of the posts did.\nAnd so then I'm like, I should just\nstick with writing\nbecause the ideas in in my head, the\nthing that I feel built my audience the\nmost, there's no way to know this, but I\nthink it came from\nmy focus on idea density and novel\nperspectives. So, in my YouTube videos\nespecially, I try to bake in at least\none thing that I think will like blow\npeople's minds as an exaggeration. It's\nlike the thing that I found so\ninteresting that I feel like not too\nmany people know about. If I can find a\nway to incorporate that into a\nnewsletter that has a pretty broad and\nvalidated angle, so people go into the\nvideo because it's already validated.\nthey like that topic, they'll just watch\nit to watch it. And then I have a good\nhook, a good lead, and then I lead them\ninto like that mind-blowing insight that\nmakes them think a bit deeper and learn\nsomething new and have something new to\nexplore that gives them this unique\nconnection with me that\nnot too many other people do.\nYeah. I mean,\ndoes that make sense?\nIt does. cuz I think like if you have\nreally good optimized ideas,\nyou don't need visuals,\nit's just so hard to come up with good\nideas. I mean, you're sharing the sauce\naround how to come up with good ideas,\nbut it it's by the way, it's not just\ngood ideas. It's good ideas that are\noptimized for feeds,\nright? because\nyou need people to reshare it to get\nseen\num or like it or comment on it. You you\nneed them to stop scrolling to to you\nknow. So for a lot of people the images\nor the videos are a bit of a crutch like\nyou can take a not so good idea crutch\nit to a really nice visual and likely\nyou you'll get more seen. I think I do\nthink that if you added\nimages or and or videos to your ex\nposts, you would see not that you need,\nyou know, another 5 million impressions\na month, but I think the way I would I\nmean I think it's fun to explore like\nSora 2 just came out.\nUm, you know, what are some short films,\ncinematic films that you can, you know,\nyou could be creating. That's one. The\nother thing is, you know, Nano Banana,\nGemini Flash 2.5,\nyou know.\nOkay, I'll show you something real\nquick. Actually, go to my my ex. So, I\nhad a um post\nthat\nI posted that got like no like scroll,\nkeep scrolling. It's like a It's a lot.\nIt's a lot down, but I had a post um\nYeah, I'll let you know when that\nbasically didn't go anywhere and then I\nreposted it with an image. There it is.\nStop. It went up. Went up. There it is.\nThe cringe mountain one. H. So, I posted\nthis. Everything I ever got in life was\nbecause I climbed cringe mountain. You\nsweat, you shake, you look stupid. And\nthen one day it breaks open and suddenly\nyou're the only one with the view. It\nwent nowhere without the, you know,\nYeah. basically nowhere without the\nimage, but once the image\ncom combined with, you know, maybe it\nwasn't a great idea, maybe it was a\npretty good idea with, I think, a really\ngreat image. It it got 148,000\nimpressions. And by the way, I hear you\nlistening to this and you're like,\n\"Yeah, but you have 500,000 followers or\nwhatever.\" The followers don't really\nmatter anymore, realistically.\nYou know, it's actually easier to get\nimpressions if you have less followers.\nIt's, you know what I mean?\nYeah.\nLike I can post something that is\njust like a throwaway tweet and it will\ngo nowhere. It'll get like a hundred\nlikes compared to a typical\n2 to 3,000.\nAnd yeah, it's just\nthe the audience is definitely a\nforce amplifier, but only if you're good\nat that thing. Like if if most people\nwho haven't practiced writing content\nfor a long amount of time were given a\nmillion followers, I do not think that\nthat would help them in the slightest.\nYeah. Cool.\nBut yeah, let's actually show a cool way\nto do this with uh Claude or in in\ncreating a prompt to help you write\ntweets or to help you, I guess, learn\nhow to write those high performing\nposts. So, one thing I love to do is\nthere's a two-step process here.\nAnything that I like and want to\nincorporate into my work, I will ask\nClaude or Chat GPT to break it down,\nteach me how to do it, I will take that\nas if it were a an SOP or just a set of\ninstructions. Then I will take a prompt\nthat helps me create prompts, send that,\npaste the instructions into it and say,\nI want to turn this into a prompt that\ninterviews me for the exact thing you\nneed in order to execute on this as best\nas possible. So as an example here is I\nsaid break down the structure of this\npost so that I can recreate it from\nscratch. break down why it works, the\npsychological patterns involved, what\ncontext is needed from me, and anything\nelse I would need to understand how to\nrecreate it. Then I just pasted I\nbelieve this is one of my tweets that\ndid pretty good. Uh how to know you were\ndoing something meaningful. You feel\nlike you don't make any progress for\nweeks, months, or years. Then the growth\nhits you all at once. When you create\nyour own path, results aren't\npredictable, and that keeps many people\nfrom sticking with it. So, you find a\ngood post. Well, first you write this,\ntell it to break it down. You find a\ngood post that you want to understand\nwhy it did so well or how it was\nwritten. But this can also be applied to\nsomething like a landing page or if\nyou're trying to write a book and you\nread someone else's book and you're\nlike, damn, that paragraph was good. I\nwant to understand how I can take my own\nidea and replicate the structure of this\nso my writing flows the same amount. Um,\nyou can do that for writing YouTube\nscripts if you're able to break down the\ntranscript. There's just so many\ndifferent things that you can do. Uh, I\nactually saw when Culie first launched,\nthey had a landing page that I really\nliked and I copy pasted the landing\npage, wrote exactly this, told it to\nbreak down every single part of the\nlanding page copy and it called it\nparadigm shift marketing and just taught\nme exactly how to replicate it. So when\nI could take that and turn it into a\nprompt and then plug my own ideas for my\nown product into it, then it could\nrewrite that same style of copy but with\nmy product, my features, my problem that\nI'm solving, unique mechanism, etc. So\nwith here uh we're breaking down a tweet\nand it breaks down the core structure,\nhook statement, pain and struggle, the\npayoff, the insight and warning, why it\nworks. And just by doing this alone, you\ncan learn so much about writing content.\nyou you\nlike this alone is a master class in\nwriting one piece of content and then\nyou can continue conversing with it and\nthat helps you write better content on\nyour own. Then it gives you a formula\nadditional elements to make this work.\nAnd then what I did here is I did the\nsame thing do the same thing with this\nand I took one of Zack Pogra's tweet and\nor Instagram posts and it was just the\nbest way to get your spark back is\nburning everything down. You have to\nreset your life. Very similar to the\nthings I like to read and write. And so\nI like this. I want it to break it down.\nI told it to. It has It broke down the\nstructure, provocative thesis, purge\nlist, the promise, the elite few, the\npermission,\nteaches me why it works,\nwriting techniques, context needed,\nwhat makes it work, and then I did the\nsame thing for one last tweet. So do the\nsame thing with this again. People in\nthird People in third world countries\nspend their days talking, playing,\ndancing, and making love. People in\nfirst world countries aspire to spend\ntheir days talking, plans, playing,\ndancing, and making love. I think about\nthis often. This was just one I found\nand I'm like, that's a good idea. I'll\nthrow it in here, too. So, the process\nof this is pretty much break down three\ntweets that you really like\nand then\ncombine all of these into a singular\nguide. So now the anatomy of viral\nphilosophical posts a complete guide\nbreaks down the three archetypes which\nwere the tweets\nand then core psychological patterns\ntechnical structure\npower techniques.\nThis is insane. This is absolutely\nmanipulation. It's it's really cool. And\nlike well imagine doing this for more\nthan just tweets like YouTube scripts\nand other things like the this is where\nit starts to all tie together. Once you\nuse this process a few you use this\nprocess a few times you realize that you\ncan use it for almost anything. And then\nif you rewind this podcast to looking at\nthe canvas that I was showing you, you\ncan now see that each chat in there was\none of these prompts that I created. So,\nif I want to turn my newsletter into\ntweets and I use this there, then it\nlike that's so much better than me\npasting my newsletter into an LLM and\nbeing like, \"Hey, what are 10 of the\nbest ideas from this? Can you write a\ntweet? Have write 10 tweets for me.\" And\nthen it writes like the worst tweets\nyou've ever read and still includes\nhashtags. So this is like how you give\nthe inspecific instructions so that it\ncan write like you or write how you want\nit to and then you can paste those\ndirectly if you'd like or you can use\nthose as ideas\nto like as a first draft a starting\npoint.\nNow the\nlast important thing here is I said from\nthat guide what is everything you would\nneed from me in order to start writing\ntweets. Everything I need to know from\nyou. Core identity, audience psychology,\nphilosophical stance, voice parameters,\nspecific insights, transformation,\nnarrative, emotional territory, so on\nand so forth. A lot of stuff. So, we're\nmaking this very comprehensive\nbecause the context is king. the the\nmore context you give to the AI, the\nmore it can get close to putting out\nwhat you actually want it to put out or\nputting out things that will blow your\nmind and that you feel confident in\nreplicating week by week in your\ncontent. So now we have two things here.\nWe have a description of the context we\nneed and we have instructions for how to\nactually write posts. So what I did next\nis I took these two things. I personally\npasted them into just a separate note\nand then start a new chat.\nAnd what I did here is I have this\nspecial this thing is a lifesaver. I use\nit all the time. It's just a prompt that\nhelps you create better prompts. So, uh\nI can share this in some way with you\nguys after, but it just it it's so good.\nYou just have to try it. makes very\ncomprehensive prompts. Um, maybe you can\npause, read through this if you'd like,\nbut I send that and then I try to use\nthe most powerful. I know 4.5 just came\nout, but 4 point I use 4.1 extended\nthinking on this because I just like to\nbe as advanced as I can when I'm\ncreating a specific prompt. And what I\ndid or said, what is the topic or role\nof the prompt you want to create? I said\nI want to create a prompt that helps me\nideulate social posts based on the guide\nfrom writing posts below. Structure this\nprompt in two phases. The first is\ncontext gathering. So interview me for\nthe ideas that I want to write about.\nAnd phase two is postw writing. So write\nthree variations of each type of post\nusing the ideas I gave you. Here's the\nadditional context. So inside of here on\nthis one, I didn't paste the context\nthat it needed from me, but I could\nhave. Right? In phase one, I could have\nsaid, \"Use the\nuh guide on what context you need from\nme in order to create interview\nquestions that you can ask me.\" And then\nphase two, use the tweet writing guide\nto take everything I gave you and turn\nthem and turn them into tweets. And so\nwhat it did after that, sometimes this\nprompt will ask clarifying questions um\nif it has them to make the prompt\nbetter.\nBut then it starts to spit out the\nprompt and it has phase one context\ngathering interview. Oh, I guess I did\npaste it in there,\nright?\nSo it's somewhere in the thing. But the\nwhen you send this prompt for writing\ntweets, it goes through it asks you what\nyour domain and expertise is, audience\npainoint, unique observation,\ntransformation, vision, personal\nconnection,\nuh what tone, specific examples, and\nthen once it has enough information,\nit'll go into phase two, which is to\ngenerate nine posts using uh\nyeah, three variations of the patient\nobserver post, which was one of the\nexamples.\nuh three variations of the dramatic\nprofit post, three variations of the\nquiet devastator posts, post structure\nrequirements, constraints, output\nformat, and then I just had it rewrite\nit as markdown without the code block so\nthat I could paste that into my notes\nbecause not a coder, don't use cursor,\nany of that, but I just keep things in\nnotes.\nBut, uh, Greg, do you have questions on\nthis?\nWhat's going through my mind is like it\nfeels like\nI've been doing content\nlike a Neanderl, you know? That's that's\nwhat it feels like cuz I just I just\nbrute force my way into it, you know? I\njust I have an idea and I d, you know,\nand I, you know, I start typing and then\nI just throw it out there. Um, it works\nfor me. Um, and sometimes,\nyou know, do what works type thing.\nOh, yeah.\nUm, that being said, what's going\nthrough my mind is we we have a lot of\naccounts, you know, cuz I run a holding\ncompany and\nI find that some of my, you know, I love\nmy team, but some of my team haven't\nbeen creating content. Like, I've been\nwriting, you know, I started a blog 20\nyears ago, you know what I mean? I've\nbeen writing for so many years that it's\njust kind of uh\nit's it's inst it's it's my instincts\nalmost now. Um so this is really helpful\nfor managing multiple accounts with\nmultiple people and you really don't\nhave an excuse not to be posting\nsomething every single day if you have\nthis.\nYeah. I mean, another way to think of\nit, too, is if you're a ghostriter,\nsocial media manager, uh you're managing\nclients, you can\nkind of send them a prompt that gets all\nof their you send it to them rather than\nlike a onboarding questionnaire that\npulls all of their details from them,\ngets examples of their best content,\netc., etc., and then you just create\nprompts for like tweets, tweet writing\nfor them. you create another prompt for\nYouTube script writing or landing page\ngeneration all based around their voice,\ntheir profile, etc. And one last example\nthat I'll share here is you can do a\nvery similar thing for almost anything\nwhere imagine I know how to create\noffers. I've like been in the marketing\nspace for so long. But a lot of people\njust starting, they have this superpower\nwhere they can start learning by doing\nfaster, right? You're it's not that\nyou're avoiding reading a book like a\nhund00 million offers by Alex Hermoszi.\nYou're able to get the information you\nneed to act and have AI act for you as a\nfirst draft so you get the first\niteration out of the way as well. So you\ncan fail faster on creating your offer\nso that you can refine faster. And in my\neyes, doing things this way isn't like\noutsourcing your agency or your\ncognition to AI. It's actually getting\nyou closer to being high agency and uh\nlearning through doing like right the\nthe best way to learn is by building\nprojects, failing, iterating, etc. So\nthe example here and how to turn this\ninto a prompt to create an offer and\nstart selling and failing on whatever\nproduct it is, a SAS startup, a physical\nproduct, a digital product, whatever. Uh\nI can just ask, give me a detailed guide\non how to create offers like Alex\nHoroszi. The reason we do this rather\nthan, hey, here's my product, help me\ncreate an offer from it is because I\nwant to narrow the context from the\nbeginning, right? I don't want AI. I I\ndon't want the LLM to pull just general\ncontext that it thinks is best for\ncreating an offer or writing copy. I\nwant it to pull from the expert that I\nknow has skin in the game here. So, it\ngives me a detailed guide with the value\nequation, building a grand slam offer,\npricing, 10x value test, naming your\noffer, etc., etc.\nAnd I think when I was doing this I cut\nmyself off. But what you can do here is\nthen I can say okay take this and\nact as if you are guiding me through\ncreating an offer. What are the exact\nsteps? make it extremely detailed and\nthen I can do the same thing I did here\nor sorry then I can ask next okay what's\nall the context you need from me\nuh in order to take my product and turn\nit into a very good offer then it'll\nspit all that out now you have two\nthings you have the set of instructions\nand you have the context that you need\nso the next thing you do is you paste\nthe prompt that helps you create great\nprompts it's going to say what do you\nwant to create I say, \"I want to create\na two-phase prompt. Here's the\ninformation that you need to interview\nme for.\" Then phase two, here's exactly\nhow to turn this into an offer. So, I\nwant you to create my offer blueprint\nfor me. And then you, it'll output a\nprompt. You copy paste this. You send\nit. You answer the questions.\nIt spits out an offer blueprint that is\nprobably 10 times better than something\nyou would have done on your own just\nthen, right? And it would probably be on\npar with what you would be able to do\nafter\ntwo to three months of actually learning\nabout it.\nAnd I believe that is it.\nWell,\nyou delivered, dude. I I you know that's\nwhy I wanted to have you\nyou actually overd delivered to be\nhonest\nnice\nand because you know I think uh my mind\nis just racing with how much more I can\ndo with content and and I you know what\nare other audiences I could be spinning\nup using this method. Um if you can uh\nyes let's include that Google doc or or\nthat doc with some of this in the show\nnotes. Um, and I appreciate that\ngenerosity.\nDan Co, I hope you come back on the pod.\nI'll include links to where you can\nfollow Dan on YouTube, on X, his\nnewsletter. Uh, what else, Dan?\nThat's it. You'll, if you're curious,\nyou'll find stuff that branches off of\nthat.\nAmazing. Thanks, Dan. I really\nappreciate it. And uh dude, takes a lot\nfor me to get to get my to get my mind\nbuzzing, but you did. You did it.\nGood. Yeah, I appreciate it, man. And\nI'm glad that it did provide value.\nThat's one thing I'm always like hopeful\nfor because you never really know. I've\nused this so much that it's like second\nnature to me. So, I'm very glad. I mean,\nI've used LLMs with content, like how\ncan you make this more clear or you know\nthat that kind of stuff, but I I this\nthe way you approach content creation is\na very methodical way of approaching\ncontent creation. It's like very\nsurgical. And\num by the way, I think this is the best\nway to learn how to create content. you\nyou might actually like everyone should\nset this up.\nMaybe over time you you you're like, you\nknow what, I'm just gonna now I\nunderstand what works and what doesn't\nwork. I'm just going to shoot from the\nhip like Greg. Um and that might be what\nyou what might, you know, end up being\ngreat for you. Or you might be like,\nhey, uh\nI'm going to double down on this and I'm\ngoing to make 20 accounts and that's\nwhat this is going to look like, you And\nI think I'm really interested in that\nbecause\num I just think that we're in this\nwindow where there's a huge o arbitrage\nopportunity to earn attention. So you\nknow any any way to help that you know\nI'm looking I'm looking for ways looking\nfor ways to optimize.\nYep. Agreed.
