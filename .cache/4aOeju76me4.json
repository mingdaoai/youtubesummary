{"transcript": "Rowan Chung is the genius behind The\nRundown. Now, the Rundown AI is a media\ncompany for AI that's generating\nmillions of dollars a year. Now, I\nthought that The Rundown had like 50,\n100, 150 employees. No, it's a lot less\nthan that. He just uses AI agents to\nactually scale the business. In this\nepisode, he unveils it all, and I think\nit's for the first time ever. How he\ncreated an AI avatar that gets millions\nof views. How he writes tweets with AI\nthat gets millions of views. How he\nwrites a newsletter with AI that gets\nmillions of views. How he created an EA\nAI agent that answers leads within\nseconds. How he's able to learn anything\nfrom a YouTube vid with AI. How he\nonboards employees with GPTs. How he\nbuilt a partnership AI agent that works\ndirectly with his team. We give away all\nthe prompts, all the tools, all the\nworkflows, all in this episode. I hope\nit gets your creative juices flowing.\nStick to the end, give us a like,\ncomment, and I'll see you at the end of\nthe episode.\n[Music]\nLong time coming. Rowan Chung on the pod\nfrom the rundown. Uh, my go-to guy when\nI need something explained in AI. Thanks\nfor coming on, Rowan. By the end of this\nepisode, what are people going to learn?\nYeah, thanks for having me. I love the\nshow. I love your content. Uh, so it's\ngreat to be here. By the end of the\nshow, I'm going to share seven ways we\nuse AI internally at the rundown.\nThey're going to be business operation\nand content creation focused. Uh, we use\nAI many ways, uh, but these are solid\nones that people can walk away with.\nWe're going to share some free templates\nthat people can steal. And then uh I\nthink we're going to riff on just some\ngeneral AI overview for the future.\nSo when you say like operations and\nsystems, what I think you're probably\ntalking about is how do you uh how do\nyou take a team that's maybe 1 2 3 four\npeople and make it seem like it's 20 30\n40 50 people. Is that right?\nThat's exactly right. So uh we have a\nteam about 15. I think we operate as\nlike a 50 person team in terms of speed,\nbut in some cases we might actually\noperate faster because like the headache\nof having 50 people is like really\nburdensome. Uh but yeah, we just use AI\nin so many different ways that uh you\nknow we operate extremely fast and we\ncan get a lot of work done.\nOkay, cool. Well, I'm here to learn just\nas much as everyone else. I think a lot\nof people who listen to that, they've\nseen other tutorials or videos and\nthey're like, \"Yeah, right. There's no\nway that AI can make a team of five turn\ninto 50. But if there's anyone who could\nprove it, it's you. So, let's get right\ninto it.\nYeah, let's get into it, man. Uh, so we\ncan start with uh this first one. Um, I\nthink this is probably the most popular\none. It went pretty viral on Twitter,\neven though I mean this is Instagram,\nbut basically the problem we were\nsolving was I have no time as a founder\nof, you know, the rundown. We're growing\nour newsletter. We're growing our edtech\nside and I also do content on the side\nas well and I'm a writer first. Like I'm\nnot great in front of the camera. Uh I'm\ngetting better, trying to get better. Uh\nbut we realized like we're creating all\nthis content in the newsletter and we\nhave all these stories and it's so in\ndemand right now with AI content and we\nneeded a way to push that writing into\nlike some short form video. At the time\nI didn't have a setup. I'd had nothing.\nSo I was like, \"Okay, I don't have any\ntime to do this. not going to like do my\nhair and get in front of the camera and\nrecord like this 5minute video, do like\nsix different takes. Uh it just wasn't\ngoing to happen. So we're like, okay,\nwhat if we run an experiment and we\nclone my face, we clone my voice and we\njust have an editor who takes my my\noriginal writing and pushes that into\ncloud script so we can you know form\nformulate that better for like short\nform and then run that through the\navatar. And then obviously it takes a\nlot of manual editing to make the pieces\nright. We got to do a lot of\nstorytelling. There's a lot of like\nB-roll that we have to add. Uh but we\nsaid, \"Hey, can we do this?\" Like this\nis going to be experiment. Uh we're very\nopen about it. So on Twitter, we're\nlike, \"Hey, we're running this\nexperiment. We're not trying to fool\nanyone. Like this is an AI avatar. Uh\nbut if anyone were to try this, like\nwe're going to try this and if it works,\nlike it's a cool use case because I\ndon't have any time to create content on\nin short form anyways.\" So, uh, yeah, we\nstarted doing it and it's been under a\nyear and we've grown to over 150,000\nfollowers. So, it's, uh, I'd say it's\nbeen a success. Yeah, you can like go\nthrough any of these. Some of the recent\nones we've been experimenting with\nmyself narrating it as well, just\nbecause I now have a studio, as you can\nsee. Uh, but I didn't have a studio\nbefore, so we just use that avatar and\nit's way better than me anyways. So, you\nkind of go through these. We had a few\nlike really viral ones.\nSam Alman, the co-founder of OpenAI,\njust said that it is the era of the idea\nguy and he is not wrong. I think that\nright now is an incredible time to be\nbuilding a startup and if you listen to\nthis podcast, chances are you think so,\ntoo. Now, I think that you can look at\ntrends uh to basically figure out uh\nwhat are the startup ideas you should be\nbuilding. So, that's exactly why I built\nideabser.com. Every single day you're\ngoing to get a free startup idea in your\ninbox and it's all backed by high\nquality data trends. How we do it?\nPeople always ask. We use AI agents to\ngo and search what are people looking\nfor and what are they screaming for in\nterms of products that you should be\nbuilding and then we hand it on a you\nknow silver platter for you to go check\nout. Um we do have a few paid plans that\nyou know take it to the next level. uh\ngive you more ideas, give you more AI\nagents and more almost like a chatgbt\nfor ideas with it, but you can start for\nfree ideabrowser.com. And if you're\nlistening to this, I highly recommend\nit.\nSo 120,000 likes. I actually saw this\none.\nThis is talking about Angilla and the.ai\ndomains being like the number one\nrevenue source for them. Is that what\nthis is?\nYeah. And you can see like u if we\nreload this,\nthe avatar is only really shown for the\nfirst like 3 4 seconds.\nUm cuz the avatar portion of it isn't\nthat great, but if you just show like 3\n4 seconds, it looks more real. Uh the\naudio on the other hand, like audio is\nthere. Uh like voice AI is really\nadvanced. I'd say video is like lagging\nbehind a little bit. Um, so the voice is\nalso AI generated, but I would say the\nvoice is sometimes it's better than me\neven like I mispronounce things all the\ntime. Uh, but yeah, this basically the\nway we do it and I have an incredible\neditor who, you know, does all the\nstorytelling. He pushes it all together.\nUm, he's taking these stories from like\nthings I've written in the past and\nyeah, it's like a cool workflow that\nworks really well for us. Um, I can't\nsay it's going to work well for\neveryone. like it does take a lot of\nwork and you do need like a really\ntalented editor to be able to do this.\nBut for like those edge cases where you\nhave no time as a founder and you really\nneed to create content, short form\ncontent, and you're already writing,\nit's just kind of like a no-brainer,\nright? Um, so yeah, that's the that's\nthe first one.\nYeah, I think uh I think the mistake a\nlot of people make here, well, there's a\nfew mistakes. one is they they don't\npick stories that are going to go viral\nwithin short form, right? So they they\nthey make the mistake of just picking I\ndon't you know boring boring content and\nwrapping it you know you could have the\nmost boring content but if it even if\nit's wrapped in the most beautiful short\nform as you know it's not going to go\nanywhere.\nYeah. Exactly. And the other thing is\nlike a lot of people think this work\nthey see this workflow and they think\nit's like one click to generate. We do a\nlot of work like my editor even says\nsometimes it would be faster if I just\ncame in and I just like quickly narrated\nit but I don't even have that like 10\nminutes of time and like that break in\nthe workflow every single day uh takes\ntakes a lot of like mental capacity. So,\nuh, it it really works for us, but I\nthink a lot of people get that wrong\nwhere they're like, \"Hey, we're going to\noneclick generate this. It's going to be\nawesome,\nand they don't spend time training the\navatar and hen.\" Um, I'd even mentioned\nthe tools we use. So, we use Hey Genen\nfor the avatar\nand we use 11 Labs for the voice. Um,\nhen has like 11 Labs integration, but\nyou actually want to do it separately\nbecause if you do it on 11 Labs, you get\nhigher quality and you just stitch it\ntogether. Uh, so those are the main two\nAI tools we use for this workflow. And\num yeah, like I said, it takes a lot of\nediting in between, but it is really\nuseful for people who do get it right\nand get those stories right like you\nsaid.\nYeah. And you can also I mean you can\nuse tools like you know Gum Loop and\nLindy and stuff like that to actually\npull in stories that are getting\ntraction on places like Reddit and then\nso it's easier to kind of pick the\nstories. I know you're actually creating\nthe stories, but most people listening\nto this probably aren't writing how many\nthousands of words you write a day.\nYeah, that's a that's a good workflow.\nUm, and the other thing is like just\nbeing active on X X where like things\nbreak break out first and I'm like me\nand you are both probably there like 247\nso we really on the pulse but yeah like\nif you're not on the pulse of things\nhaving something like a gum loop\nintegration where it's like\neven pinging you on Slack uh for the\ntop stories that are breaking out right\nnow that would be really useful. Yeah.\nCool. Um before we move on to the to the\nnext thing you want to show, why\nshouldn't someone, you know, people\nlistening to this are, you know, are\nstarting companies, they're starting\nbusinesses, they're starting cash\nflowing businesses. Why shouldn't they\ndo this?\nWell, I think um I actually got asked\nthis by like a public company. He asked\nme how to do this and I went to his\noffice and I explained the whole thing\nand he's really interested. Uh, and in\nhis case, I actually think it was\nsomewhat useful because he's actually\nfrom Switzerland and in Switzerland\nthere's four different languages and he\nhas to like record these videos in four\ndifferent languages every single day and\nit's like it takes up hours of his day.\nUh, so for him it's kind of is useful.\nBut for like the regular everyday CEO,\nthere is some element to it where there\nis like AI hate, right? if using an AI\navatar for creating your videos, people\nare going to think, \"Oh, it's like not\nas authentic.\" Um, for me, it really\nworked because we're very open about it\nand I'm like kind of like the AI guy.\nSo, people accept it. They're like, \"Oh,\nthis is really cool. He's actually\npracticing what he's preaching.\" But for\nlike a public publicly traded company,\nCEO probably shouldn't do this. should\nprobably be as authentic authentic as\npossible and strive for like the human\nelement and really like um push for like\nthat human experience because like as we\nget into the age of AI generated content\nand there's just like seas of a\ngenerated content you want to push for\nlike that human layer uh because that's\nreally your moat. Uh but for us again\nlike it works uh for our specific case\nand there's some cases that it will work\nbut yeah like like you said there's\ndefinitely some areas we don't want to\nuse this.\nI mean I think what's so smart and I'm\njust took some notes on this. I think so\nsmart about your approach is the video\navatar piece is like 2% of the video.\nYou know it's and you're just using\nB-roll. So, I think um\neven if you are a public company CEO,\nlike if you're like me or you, by the\nway, people think it's funny because\nwe're we're on video a lot, but people\ndon't realize we actually don't like\nvideo. Like we're we're actually like\nI'm afraid of the camera, you know? Um\nI've tried to do short form and I tried\nto like dead pan into the camera and I'm\nlike not good at it and I don't I just\nhonestly don't I don't feel good after.\nThat's the best way to describe it. I\ndon't feel good after. I'm not good with\na camera. So, I think there's a lot of\npeople like us who know that there's so\nmuch value in short form, who know that\nif we actually just looked in the camera\nand spoke these stories that we know we\nwould actually crush it and that, you\nknow, if you climb cringe mountain, um,\nyou could get to 151,000 followers and\njust like pick up millions of views.\nThat can absolutely change the\ntrajectory of your life. That being\nsaid, we don't want to do it. So, I\nthink that for anyone who's listening to\nthis, this is an interesting approach at\nleast to try as an experiment for 30\ndays and then see how you feel about it.\nYeah. And in another case on like the\npros side of things is faceless channels\ngo viral all the time and they generate\nmillions of dollars for people, right?\nor even you see these animated\ncharacters on YouTube that it's like\nthis trend now as well and you can build\na following and a community through\nanimated content. Why can't you do it\nthrough like an avatar? And is this\ngoing to be more popular as time goes\non? Right now like it's you got to\nstitch things together, right? Uh it\nwill get a lot easier and that means\nmore people will do it. So, we'll see\nlike what the what the world really\nthinks about it as as things get more\npopular, but for now, it's definitely\nlike a huge arbitrage opportunity and\nand we grew the account to 150,000. Um,\nand you know, it's working for us.\nWell, thanks for sharing that sauce.\nWhat else? What else you got?\nYeah, the next one, um, I mean, this is\na pretty simple one. I'm sure you do\nthis all the time as a writer, but uh\nit's just voice dictated writing and you\npush it into a claude like workflow. Um\nso there's no like magic secret other\nthan this prompt.\nSo you I mean people can we can like\ndrop this in the description.\nYeah.\nUh but it's basically just a prompt to\ntrain on your writing style, right? So I\ngrabbed all of my top performing tweets\non X ever, right? Uh I have like 10 to\n20 of them. I dropped this prompt into\nClaude. Um, and you basically just push\nall of your best writing and it's going\nto be trained on your tweets. And then\nuh I'm This is a pretty popular\nworkflow, but just like I like going on\nwalks and talking on my phone. I have my\nmy best ideas while I'm walking. So, I\njust like walk and I just have Whisper\nFlow open and I just like jam on\ndifferent things and then I have a bunch\nof different notes and then when I come\nhome I just like push into this chat\nthat's trained on my writing and then\nyou just get really really good tweets.\nUm,\nso like for this this example,\nthey're pretty optimized tweets. You\nstill have to go in and edit it a little\nbit. Like you want to get this. So once\nI get this, I'm going to like push it\ninto like Twitter for example. And I'm\ngoing to add a couple lines that are\nmore like give more insight, right? The\ninsight part. AI sucks at giving like\nhuman insight and experience. Comparing\ncertain things to like other models, for\nexample, and just like tweaking up\nlittle things that just don't seem\nright. Like Claude likes to exaggerate a\nlot. Like I say like words like game\nchanger. Um, but this is like a really\nreally good starting point where it\ntakes you from like walking to literally\ntweet is 90% ready. Uh, and I what I do\nis every single Sunday I just go on this\nreally long walk and I just jam on my\nphone and I have a bunch of different\nvoice notes and I just like push it into\nhere and I'll have all my tweets ready\nby the end of like Sunday and I'll like\ncue them all up and then uh yeah, it's\nlike a really good workflow that works\nfor me. uh when you want to push out a\nlot of content. Um but yeah, do you use\nsomething similar?\nWell, I have a question on your walk\npiece. So,\nyeah.\nDo you just go on a walk and ideas hit\nyou? Um or do you have like I I know I'm\nspeaking about myself. I have an Apple\nnotes called ideas and in my Apple Notes\nI have these kind of halfbake ideas that\nthen I'll use whisper flow to to\nactually dictate it in. Um, but are, you\nknow, I'm just curious like do you do\nyou start from nothing or do you start\nfrom something?\nI usually start from nothing. The ideas\nreally come to me when I'm walking. I\nmight have like some broader things that\nI'm just thinking about\nand I don't know. I think I work so much\nthat I don't have thoughts until I start\nwalking. Like my mind is almost numb\nbecause I'm working so much. So once I\nstart walking and like I'm not looking\nat Slack, these ideas just come to me\nand I just just start jamming um from\nthere and yeah, it's a really good\nworkflow for me to to just have tweets\nlike 90% ready when I come home and\nstart queuing them up. Obviously, I'll\nadd like an image or some kind of video\nbecause video content does really well\non Twitter. Uh but yeah, this is like a\npretty simple one that I think will be\nuseful to a lot of people who are trying\nto create like LinkedIn content or\nTwitter content.\nOn uh my last question on this workflow\nis you mentioned this is really good at\ngetting you know 0 to 90%. Um but the\nlast 10% is everything. So what are you\nknow what are the prompts? You you you\nkind of mentioned a little bit of this\nbut what are the prompts that help you\nget it from 90 to 100 or is it just you?\nA lot of it is me, but you can go back\nand forth a little bit. On the next\nexample, I'm going to share uh it's a\nvery it's basically the same thing, but\nI use it for my newsletter. I'll share\nlike how we like go back and forth and\nuse as an editor. Uh but yeah, a lot of\nit is like you take the tweet, you add\nin your insights, you refine it, and\nthen you ask again. You're like, \"Hey,\nhow is this? What do you think? Make it\nbetter.\" And then it's going to give you\nlike some suggestions. Then again, you\ndon't use them all, but the one\nsuggestion that it might suggest that\nyou didn't think about could be like the\nreason why that post goes viral, right?\nUh so it's just like you have to develop\nthis intuition of knowing when it's a\ngood suggestion versus when it's not a\ngood suggestion. It just comes with\nreps.\nBut yeah, it Claude is amazing as an\neditor.\nAnd do you ever have is this Cloud Max?\nUh, that's actually a long story. So, I\nactually can't get Claude Max because um\nI'm my account was like upgraded by\nAnthropic and it's like a whole thing.\nWe're like trying to figure it out.\nBut yeah, this is just regular pro pro\naccount.\nSo, and and you never have the issue of\nI know we're getting to the\nnitty-gritty, but I actually think\npeople want to know the nitty-gritty.\nYou never get to the issue of\nlike the chat is too long, therefore you\nhave to start chat. Yeah, that's I mean\nthis is a huge issue that everyone\nalways has problems with. I'll get to\nlike the so this is the next example I\nwas going to share. It's basically this\nexact same prompt but we use it this is\na different like use case we use as an\neditor. Uh and this is exactly what\nyou're saying. So you can see like how\nlong this chat is, right? Like this is\ninsane. And it's really like when we\nwrite our newsletter, we write it all by\nhand, but we like to use Claude as like\nan editor-inchief,\nright? And it's you're going back and\nforth with it. You're asking for\nsuggestions. You're saying, \"Oh, how is\nthis? What do you think? Like, can we\nmake this better?\" It's going to give\nyou some ways and you say, \"Oh, can we\nmake this a little bit shorter? Can we\nmake this two words shorter?\" Because\nthat's a fit in like our email format,\nright? And Claw's extremely good at\nthis, but to your point, when the chat\ngets too long, Claw's just going to say,\n\"Hey, you this chat's too long. You you\ncan't journ anymore.\" There's pretty\nsimple hack. Um, you literally just go\nto\nYou literally just go to another chat\nsomewhere not too far off. You want to\nmake sure there's enough contact still\ncuz the chat like Claude actually gets\nbetter as it goes. But you want to go to\nhere for example. You see I have two\nedits and you literally just go in here\nand you can like exit that out and you\ncan start from there.\nWow.\nI didn't realize that.\nYeah. Yeah. You can literally just start\nstart again like just a tiny bit up and\nit just keeps going. Uh so especially if\nyou're using as an editor. Uh so for\nexample, we go to my newsletter here.\nand we grab like a main main par.\nObviously, we already published this,\nbut if we were editing this still, um,\nwe would write this all by hand and we\nsay literally like this is literally the\nprompt. Make it better.\nMhm.\nIt's super simple, but you hit save and\nit's just going to start from here. Like\nall that bottom part gets erased and\nyou're going to be able to continue the\nchat.\nSo, do you have to look for like a one\ntwo situation? Is that what you have to\nlook for? Like or could it be\nNo, no, it can be anywhere. I I just\nshowing that example because\nit's I guess it's kind of proof that I I\ngenuinely do this like now it says\nthree, right? But if you go further up,\nyou'll see some where it's like\n10 or 12 because I just like stay on\nthis chat. I've trained it. It works\nwell. You don't want to retrain every\ntime. It's kind of annoying.\nYeah.\nUm but yeah, this is basically the\nworkflow. like it's going to give you\nsome refi a refined version and you're\nnot going to copy and paste this. That's\nthe worst thing you can do. But you're\ngoing to read this and you're going to\nhave, you know, your article open on the\nthe other page. You're going to compare\nit and you say, \"Oh, that's a better way\nof actually explaining that bullet\npoint. Let's like grab that and, you\nknow, refine this word, right?\" And it's\nreally it it actually takes more time to\nedit with AI as a co-editor, but your\ncontent gets so good because it's\ntrained on your best writing and you're\njust going to find these small details\nthat you wouldn't have otherwise seen.\nLike even if you hire someone, it's like\nit takes so much time for them to go\nthrough it all. And this you're really\nin control. Uh so you have like an\neditor-in chief that you're in control\nof. And yeah, it's just been a game\nchanger for us, writing content\nnewsletter, but also just like writing\ncontent on LinkedIn, Twitter. Uh it's a\nreally good way of doing it.\nCool.\nYeah. So the next one, this is a more\nfun one. Uh but we use Lindy. So I know\nyou had Flo on the pod. Uh he's great. I\nlove Flo.\nBut this is just a meeting schedule\nagent. So, um,\nLindy actually provides like a template\nfor this, but I've modified it a little\nbit because I wanted like my workspace\nemail. So, I actually created an agent\nand I called it Ava. Um, so Lindy has\nthis like they give this own template\nand they use like their email domain,\nbut I basically switch it up and I\nswitch a lot of the AI prompts to\nbasically um, use my workspace domain.\nSo basically what this does is whenever\nI'm in like a Gmail chat and here I can\nactually show you an example. Whenever\nI'm in a Gmail chat, I can literally\njust CC in Ava. So Ava at ther\nrundown.ai AI and then Ava will come in\nand like literally look at my Google\ncalendar and find available times. Uh\nand we set that parameter of like where\nI actually want available time because\nlike you don't want your full 40hour\nwork week available for meetings, right?\nYou want to have some deep work blocks.\nSo, we scheduled exact times of like\nwhere I actually want to take calls and\nit will actually will look through your\ncalendar and request uh those exact\ntimes and say, \"Hey, did any of these\nwindows work for you?\" Um the other\nperson can respond, say that time works,\nand then it will go ahead and book and\nit'll actually book in your calendar. Uh\nand then this whole section here is\nbasically like rescheduling. So it's\nlet's say this person came back in the\nthread and say oh actually this didn't\nwork this this time didn't work let's\nreschedule for I don't know like the\nlast time here then Ava will literally\ngo in and cancel the event and then\nreschedule another uh meeting and it's\njust like a really nice way to I don't\nknow not send a calendarly link.\nOkay.\nUh so yeah it's it's a cool little use\ncase. Um, and you can actually take it a\nstep further. I don't have it in this\nworkflow. I have it in another one. Um,\nbut you can take it a step further and\nactually enable this across your whole\nteam.\nSo, uh, your entire team can loop in\nthat one email. So, Ava at therundown.AI\nand Ava will be attached to their\ncalendar and you can just literally Ava\nis the meeting scheduler. It's the go-to\nmeeting scheduler and you don't need\nCalendarly. And I know there's this\nweird stigma around Calendarly. I don't\nknow how many people who watch your\npodcast know about this. I don't know\nwhy. I don't agree with it. Uh but like\nif you send a Cali link, it's kind of\nknown I don't it's kind of disrespectful\nalmost. Um so having an agent that books\nthe meetings for you uh is just like a\nbetter way to work around that and it's\nuseful for your whole team. So uh yeah,\nit's a cool little agent we built.\nGo back to your email. Uh so let me let\nme explain why I think that this is such\na game changer. So um a lot of people\nlistening to this\nsell a service or product sell you know\nbut a lot of people listening to sell\nservices when you're in the services\ngame time is of the essence. So if you\nknow uh\nwho is this person Nicole. So if Nicole\nis like a lead basically you want to get\nthis time booked as quick as possible.\nWhen I'm looking exactly when I'm\nlooking you know where I'm going with\nthis. When when I'm looking at the time\nstamps, I'm looking, you know, uh\nbasically you're responding\ninstantaneously with the Lindy AI agent,\nit's a minute.\nIt's a minute.\nYeah,\none minute. And even if you go down, you\nscroll down. I even think Yeah. 642.\nNicole goes, \"Hi, Ava. Tuesday at 7:30\nworks for me.\" Um\n6:42 responds, right? Ava responds.\nSounds great. I just sent the invite. So\nthat the the gap like if you would have\n6:42 p.m. your EA your human EA might be\noff, you know.\nIt works for you 24/7.\nIt worked for you 24/7. So I think that\npiece of it is so valuable.\nIt definitely is. Um\nI mean and for you too, right? Like even\nfor like you know you guys sell\nsponsorships for example and maybe like\nMicrosoft you know CMO of Microsoft\ncomes in right and you want that meeting\nyou know also might be someone\ninteresting so you want to make sure\nthat you know the these busy people that\ntime gets booked.\nYeah. Yeah. You can actually use this\nfor partnerships. So we tried this for\nsome time. We turned it off recently,\nbut we tried this for some time where we\nhave this workflow where we have a form.\nWe we obviously have big distribution.\nSo, a lot of our leads come internally\ninbound. So, a lot of these people come\ninbound, they answer a form, we get all\nthese questions and we use those\nquestions we push into Lindy and it\nbasically validates them. And then based\non that, if they're validated, Lindy\ngoes aheads and like sends a sponsorship\nemail right away and then they can\nliterally go back and forth and if they\nwant to book a call, then they book a\ncall with my human salespeople. uh it\nworked for a while, but um yeah, we're\ngetting like the use cases where you\nwhen you do get to like Microsoft and\nlike Google um I'm just a little a\nlittle weary of using agents right now\nbecause\nthere are like occasional times where\nlike it could go wrong and just that\nlike 1%\nknowing that it could go wrong 1% just\nworries me for those like really high\ntier clients. But when you have so much\ninbound, it's it's extremely useful. Um,\nbut for this meeting use uh meeting\nschedule use case, it's it's perfect.\nSo, we can like drop this template as\nwell. I'm happy to to share it in the\nYouTube comments or something.\nYeah, let's do it.\nBut yeah, anyone can just steal it. Like\nliterally, all you have to do is connect\nyour own email.\nYep.\nSo, um, you probably don't want to use\nAva at theundown.ai. So, you're going to\nwant to change that. And then, um,\nhere's where you basically add all the\nemails of your team. So this is my So\nthis is the one with only mine right\nnow, but you change your email and then\nyou want to connect your Google calendar\nand then um in here the only thing you\nreally need to change for these two send\nreplies is at the end it says best Ava.\nSo if you change your if you change the\nname of it, you don't have to call it\nAva obviously, but you can change the\nname of it. And um yeah, you can call it\nwhatever you want. And also here, sorry,\none more. You want to make sure you\nchange when your uh meeting hours are,\nright? You don't want to have the the\nwhole day, otherwise, you know, people\nare gonna schedule random times. So, you\nfor me, I only have three-hour blocks um\nfour days a week. So, that's like my\nmeeting times. Um so, yeah, those are\nreally that's really it what you want to\nchange. Uh but yeah, we're happy to drop\nthat in the chat.\nAppreciate that. All right. So, the next\none,\nthis one's a kind of research use case\nand it's with Perplexity Comet. Uh, so\nhow did you get access to Perplexity?\nI did. I did.\nYeah. So, it's pretty cool. Um, my\nstickiest use case is using it as an AI\ntutor for like every video like long.\nFor example, this video itself, right?\nIf I don't want to sit through the whole\nthing and I just want to see Rowan's\nseven use cases, tell me exactly how to\ndo it, Perplexity can get you that in\nlike two seconds.\nUm, so it's incredible use case for just\nsummarizing these long videos and it's\nreally sticky. Like I really like this\nuse case, but it's also useful for\njust going deeper on topics you don't\nunderstand, right? So, for example, I\nuse chatbt a lot or chatb voice when I'm\nuh reading. So, I'll just have it open\nnext to me and whenever there's a topic\nI don't really understand, I'll just ask\nit, oh, hey, what does this mean? And\nI'll go deeper with it before I move on\nto the next page and really helps like\nretention.\nU but perplexity comment is basically\nthat for every YouTube video or podcast\nthat's on YouTube. So, you have this\nwidget that's on the side of your tab,\nuh, your comment tab, and you just go\ninto like these mini rabbit hole\nsessions, and you can understand things\nway deeper than if you were just\nwatching the video. Um, so every video\nin essence becomes like an AI tutor.\nSo, yeah, I think it's pretty pretty\nincredible. Uh, I learned so much better\nlike this. I never did well with school.\nUm, so YouTube videos are always my jam\nand this is like a huge game changer for\nme.\nI haven't tried I honestly haven't I've\nbeen playing with\nassistant like all day every day like\nPerplexity Assistant, but I've never\ntried it with YouTube videos. So, I'm\ndefinitely going to try it. I'm like you\nalso like I learn from YouTube. Um, and\nlike not surprisingly and uh I also I've\ngot like my m Mount Rushmore of people I\nreally look up to and like you know DHS\nis awesome in this example right I would\nlove to learn about AI from from Darmsh\nright um and I could do that with\nassistant or or even like imagine\nsomeone listening to this right like\nwith the Lindy AI example it's like okay\nthis is you know\nI have a question about you uh you know\nwhat Rowan said about Lindy templates\nand then you can just like post it there\nand just have a full-on conversation\nwith basically AI Rowan using perplexity\ncomment.\nExactly. And and the cool thing is the\ncomment assistant is grounded the entire\ncontext of the video.\nYep.\nSo you can really ask it anything about\nthe entire video and it's going to be\nsmarter than like a regular perplexity\nwould because it actually has that\ncontext. So, exactly like you said, me\nand you might not not have time to\nrespond to every single comment like of\nthis YouTube video, but you can ask\ncomment and comment will probably have\nthe answer and might actually answer\nbetter than we would. So, yeah, it's\nit's incredibly useful. I've been using\nas a tool. Um, so hopefully it's useful\nto other people as well.\nI mean, doesn't Dia have their version\nof of an assistant as well? DIA the\nbrowser.\nYeah, they have. Uh, I have not used it\nas much as I should have.\nUm, to be honest, Comet came out like\nright after and I'm like, \"Okay, let's\nget on this.\" I heard Dia also does\nthis, but\nI don't know. I like Perplexity.\nUh, and it's just really sticky. Like, I\ndon't really want to switch at this\npoint. It works, right?\nYeah. Let us know in the comment section\nif people have used Dia and that works\nor or if you prefer a comment.\nYeah, I'd love to know as well.\nYeah. I'm just curious. Uh was there one\nmore you wanted to share or was that it?\nYeah, I got I got two more two quick\nones. Um this one is a GPT for new hire\nonboarding.\nUh so probleming\nnew hires is extremely\nextremely tedious when you're scaling\nyour business, right? Everything's\ngrowing really fast, but you need new\npeople to take over parts of your\nbusiness so you can scale higher. Um,\nbut like teaching them the ins and outs\nof your company, teaching them the\nprocesses, teaching them how you use AI,\nteaching them the tools that you use,\nthere's so many questions and it just\nslows everything down, right? Uh so we\nbuilt this GPT that's trained on SOPs um\nliterally Loom transcripts, meeting\nnotes, our policies on AI usage, HR\ndocs, any like admin related question\nand it also knows everyone on the team\nand their um their role. So basically\nthe model then becomes don't ask\nquestions you haven't asked GPT first\nbecause the GPT literally knows more\nabout the company than I know. I don't\nremember all of these policies even. Um\nso you can literally ask it anything\nabout our company. You can ask it if if\nwe can take vacation today and it'll\nlike answer it and then if it doesn't\nknow it will point you to the right\nperson on the team to ask. So then you\ngo and ask your manager. Um but yeah\nit's a little little hack we use. uh to\nbasically scale faster, easier, save\ntime for the managers. Um and yeah, it's\nit's pretty useful. We can go into the\nback end here. So for anyone watching\nthis, if you just want to grab this\nprompt, it's a pretty simple prompt. Um,\nbut really it's just you're making GPT\ninto a custom onboarding assistant and\nthen you just want to drop as much\nknowledge as uh as you can and you can\nalways update this which is the cool\nthing. So as you get more team members\nas you you know create more HR policies\nthat sort of stuff you just drop it in\nand the GPT just gets updated and it's\nreally useful.\nI need to do this. I need to do this. Uh\nit's useful. It's also one of those\nthings where some people are afraid to\nask these questions, so they don't.\nYeah. So,\num\nI think that for a lot of employees,\nthis will just be\nso helpful for them. um that they can\njust any time of day, night, they don't\nhave to, you know, look,\nyou know, when you're asking a question,\nespecially if you're first starting out,\nyou don't want to be, you want to make a\ngood impression. So, I can totally\nunderstand where people are coming from\nthere.\nYeah. And really like this thing answers\nquestions immediately. You don't have to\nwait for your manager to respond. And\nlike someone like me, I have so many\nother things that I'm trying to remember\nthat like I don't remember all of our\npolicies. So, if someone asks me a\nquestion, I'm going to have to go in and\nlook in our drive and like look through\nthe points and be like, \"Oh, no. Um,\nsorry, you can you can't take this day\noff, but you can take next week off.\"\nYep.\nBut like this assistant can answer that\nimmediately.\nSo, it's a pretty useful thing as you're\nscaling your business.\nAnd then the last use case I want to\nshare, um, this is a little bit more a\nniche use case, but uh, it actually\nprobably be useful for you as well, but\nfor anyone that has a ton of\nreplies to like their business email\ninbox. So, for example, we have two main\ninboxes that we use this for. Our\nsupport inbox and then our newsletter\nemail inboxes. So obviously we get a ton\nof people who just reply to our\nnewsletters and we get a ton of out of\noffice email responses, a ton of spam,\nbut like there will be really good\nfeedback in between some of that junk\nand that's gold, right? So we we need\nthat and we need to respond to those\nthat feedback because those are like our\nour winning readers or winning\ncustomers, right? Um so this agent does\nthree things. one, it filters out the\nreal genuine customer support in the\ninbox. So, it like filters out all the\nspam. And then two, it pings the right\npeople on my team in Slack if there's\nanything important. So, for example, if\nthere's something um sponsor related, it\nwill go ping our sponsor team. If it's\nsomething education related, it will go\nping our education team. If it's\nsomething like deliverability or I don't\nknow someone tried to unsubscribe but\nthey couldn't then it will ping me. Uh\nso it's automatically pinging people on\nthe team. Um and then the last thing it\ndoes it actually autodraft replies in\nthe email inbox. So uh when we go in to\nrespond to some of these people the the\nresponses are like nearly there. It's\nthe same thing with the the voice\ndictation workflow where it will be like\n90% there. We still have to sometimes\nadd context, but it's quite good at\nsaving a lot of time. And this is the\nonly way we found that\nwe don't miss any of those like really\nimportant emails in between all the spam\nand the out of office emails.\nYeah, it's I have this issue. I actually\nhave on my YouTube I have my email and\nI'll be honest, I don't even really look\nat it. So, I'm getting like tons of\nemails\nthat I'm getting time we didn't look at\nit either because it's like you're\ngetting\nhundreds if not thousands a day. It's\nimpossible, right? But there is that\nreally good feedback in the middle. This\njust handles all of it. It\njust runs one time per day as well. So\nit's not going to be using up all your\nZapier credits. It just runs once per\nday\nand then it's just going to ping you in\nSlack if there's anything important. So\nyou know Yeah. You know if there's\nanything important. And we've actually\nlanded two sponsors through this.\nLike it's really weird that they don't\ngo through our actual sponsor form, but\nthese are legit sponsors from like big\ncompanies that went through a support\ninbox,\nright? There's there's really important\nuh messages that that come in there. So,\nI'm happy to share this one as well. Um\nit's pretty simple to set up. Uh it's\nusing Zapier agents. So, it's like their\nagent feature and we use actually their\ntheir co-pilot. Um, so we just literally\njust dropped this prompt in their\nco-pilot\nand uh it actually builds the zap out\nfor you. Like you actually don't have to\ndo anything if you use this prompt. So\nwe can share this prompt in the chat if\nanyone wants to use it. You just got to\ndrop this in the co-pilot. It'll\nautomatically generate all the\nconnections and then you just have to\nlike uh connect it to your Slack or\nemail and uh all that stuff. But it's\nready to it will be set up in like 2\nminutes if you have this prompt.\nBeautiful. This is helpful.\nUm,\nyes, all of the stuff from today will be\nin the in the show notes for people uh\nto access. And I appreciate you sharing\nthat, man. A lot of people actually come\non here and they're like, \"No, I'm not\nsharing that.\" Um, but Rowan, you're the\ntype of guy, you know, you're a sauce\nfactory, so that that's why I have you\non here. And um, thank you for for being\nso generous with with with your time and\nand and your Yeah. the whole everything\nof course man and again there's so many\nother ways we use AI I tried to stick to\nthe content creation and kind of unique\nbusiness operation ones but yeah we use\nit across like coding we have marketing\nworkflows we have uh stuff we do for\neducation as well um so yeah happy to to\ncome on and jam anytime and jam on some\nother stuff but uh hopefully this is a\ngood starting point\nyeah if you want if you want Rowan to\ncome back on we we got to scream to come\nback come back on. So let us know in the\ncomment section. I'm going to include\nplaces where you can follow Rowan AI\nRowan noni Rowan in the show notes. X\nemail newsletter\num Instagram I'll include that. Is there\nany anything else Rowan you want to\nshare before we head out?\nNo, that sounds good. Um I'm mostly\nactive on X. Yeah. And yeah, if you if\nyou don't subscribe to the rundown and\nyou want to keep up with everything in\nAI, it's uh the easiest place. So, we'll\nwe'll put that in the notes as well. But\nyeah, it's it's a great it's been great\ncoming on and I'm a huge fan of the\nshow. So, yeah, it's been awesome.\nI want you to come back again, man. I\nwant you to come back again. I want the\ncomment section to be roaring so that\nyou'll you'll know that it's not just\nme, right? It's it's it's the people the\npeople want you want you on. So, um I\nhave a feeling that that they're going\nto like this episode and uh I'll see you\nnext time.\nCool.\nYeah, appreciate it.", "language": "en-US", "title": "Screensharing How This Guy Makes Millions with AI Agents"}
