{"transcript": "Hey everyone and welcome to another episode of the what the finance podcast. On this episode I have the pleasure of welcome back Michael How. So Michael is the founder and managing director of crossber capital. So Michael thanks so much for coming back on the podcast. >> Great pleasure to be here Anthony. There's a lot going on in markets right now. We're in for a bit of bit of a rocky ride looking at current trends. >> Yeah really interesting. Okay so yeah I'd like to get go into a little bit more. What are you currently seeing in the economy and markets? Well, I think the thing to start with is um you know where we are in the liquidity cycle and you know we've been warning for you know few months now that we're getting near the peak. I mean we haven't really been going risk off but we've been saying that we're getting closer to that peak and that peak could be you know a watershed clearly for risk asset markets. Uh it was great on the way up as liquidity was going into markets and it may be a pretty difficult ride on the way down if that roller coaster starts to dip and uh start to go back towards a trough and that is really the danger we've got to try and spot. Uh you know we've been arguing that if you look at the liquidity cycle it was anyway slated to peak sometime later this year probably early or possibly early 2026. Um, you know, a lot of people are suggesting it's different this time. It's always dangerous to say that. So, I think we've got to be alert to the normal uh tempo, the normal frequency of the cycle, and that says that we're in the gray area now or the cycle could end fairly fairly quickly or fairly soon. And we got to be alert to that, you know, any tensions in markets that we're seeing. And I think what we're beginning to spot are signs that we may be getting an inflection. Now the key question is how the policy makers react to that. Uh you know it's not over until it's over of course and policy makers may react positively but I think the problem is is they're sort of grappling around now trying to find exactly where they are. They're not too sure themselves and there's a growing reluctance particularly among key US policy makers. I'm thinking here of Scott Besson, Treasury Secretary, Steven Miran, the new appointee of the FOMC, and actually J Pal himself, chair of the Fed, to say that they don't really want to be expanding the Federal Reserve balance sheet anymore. Again, I don't want to do a QE uh because they reckon it's uh it's illdirected or mis can be misdirected. It basically inflates asset markets over the real economy and it really has been behind these great wealth inequalities that we begin begin to see you know opening up in western societies. So the argument is they want the real economy to benefit now not Wall Street and that is really a tension that we've got to try and work our way through. So if you look at the data uh and I'm going to switch to a presentation now. Okay. So what we have here is the global liquidity cycle and this is the cycle of money flow that is going through world financial markets. It measures money in financial markets not money in the real economy. Uh it is not a money supply measure per se. Uh it really looks at uh if you like the balance sheet capacity of uh credit providers worldwide. So it's really the capacity of the system to lend and what this is showing is this flow of money and you can see that it's cyclical. Um this chart reflects the growth rate or the underlying momentum uh of liquidity flow. We've got the data here going back to the mid1 1960s. Um it uh has been I mean we've been monitoring this you know continuously for the last 30 years. So uh a lot of this data has been put forward in real time and the dotted red line is a sine wave that we imposed on that or or calculated and overlaid on that data uh about 25 years ago in fact in year 2000. Uh it was derived by a furer analysis of cycles. It's a sine wave and uh it's just been extrapolated thereafter. So what you see is what you get. it hasn't been force-fitted if you like and basically that cycle is moving in a five to six year wave. Uh that wave is a refinancing a debt refinancing wave. So the average u duration of the liquidity cycle of 5 to 6 years or 65 months happens to correspond almost exactly to the average uh length of debt or maturity of debt in the world economy. So hence it's a refinancing a debt refinancing cycle and it reached its low point in October of 2022 and has been rising pretty consistently thereafter with a couple of little wobbles maybe but uh we're heading towards a peak and it may be that peak is coming now because if you look at the latest inflection downwards which occurred last month in September um that was really uh forced by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve which seems to be taking u quite a lot of liquidity out of markets and that clearly is a worry. Uh we've got to be alert to that. Now the risks in the system are that if you don't have liquidity you get a financial crisis and I'm going to show um that mechanism and I'm going to come on to deal with what the Federal Reserve is really doing uh or maybe is actually doing and maybe what it doesn't intend to do. In other words, this could be an accident. Uh but let's work through the mechanics of the repo market and what's going on. So if you look at the length of a cycle, you can see according to this chart that the average cycle is that broken black line. Uh this ranges from 1970 to 2025 and the red line is the current cycle. So although we haven't yet started to inflate downwards, um it does show that uh we're somewhere near the peak of a liquidity cycle. uh and this is clearly something we've got be we have to be very alert to. Now what does this mean? Uh if you look at asset allocation, this diagram shows uh the schematic cycle and on the left hand side we look at different phases of the liquidity cycle which we generically call calm, speculation, turbulence, rebound. Risk on is an upswing and risk off is a downswing. And then on the right hand side you can see what that means for asset allocation uh in the same phases of the cycle. So equities do really well in the on the way up through the riskon phase. Cash or defensive assets are what you really want in the risk off downswing. Bonds excel at the trough that's long duration government bonds and commodity markets do really well at the peak. and commodities are racing ahead now. Uh looking at at world markets, commodity prices are clearly lifting significantly and that is really evidence of the fact that we're somewhat near the peak of the liquidity cycle. So everything kind of lines up and that's what we intend to do when we look at we study markets. We look for consistency and to try and pinpoint where we are in the cycle and this suggests to us that the peak is uh is close. Now what are the problems if you get near a peak and what are the risks of a market selloff? Uh for that we need to go to uh this schematic diagram which is describing the world financial system. Now what this diagram principally says uh is that at the heart of global financial markets is a debt liquidity nexus. Now this is not the typical understanding of textbook finance uh because they tend to ignore this model. Uh their view is that capital markets are all about raising new capital uh for investment projects. Um unfortunately that's a very archaic or outofdate view. U financial markets that are all about refinancing debt. And if you look at the right hand side uh text it says something like 70 to 80% of all transactions uh in markets primary transactions are refinancing or debt refinancing transactions on our on our estimates. So at the heart of the system is this liquidity debt nexus. The paradox is that uh debt needs liquidity for refinancing and liquidity needs debt or good quality debt uh for collateral backing. And on the left hand side you see the collateral markets the repo collateral markets and something like 77% uh very precise figure but that comes from the world bank of all global lending now is collateral backed and that's something which has uh moved up substantially as a proportion since the global financial crisis. Now in order to monitor the health of the repo and the collateral markets two things are very important. One is the volatility of collateral. In other words, the volatility of US treasury bonds which are mainly used as collateral. Uh so volatility move index monitor that. And the other is sofa spreads which is uh the rates in the interest rates in the repo markets which are really reflecting whether you get a collateral or uh liquidity imbalance. Now what we can see uh on this chart here is the ratio between debt and liquidity and you'll see the history going back to 1980 annually which is showing the debt to liquidity ratio. What I've done is annotated on the graph where you get financial crisis. I would argue that every financial crisis in the past uh 50 years has really been a debt refinancing crisis and that occurs when you get high debt liquidity ratios. There's far too much debt uh for the pool of liquidity to refinance and when you get that imbalance you get a refinancing crisis and the central banks have to come back in. If you look at the lower part of the chart, what it says there is that if you get excessive liquidity, uh then you get a situation where you get asset bubbles because asset markets are the vent for excess liquidity and you get a housing bubble, a Japan bubble, a Y2K bubble or what we've just been through which is the everything bubble. Now the everything bubble was unique um for two reasons. One is that when you got a crisis be it um the GFC be it COVID policy makers did threw liquidity at the system so there was lots of cash coming in and secondly they made the error of slashing interest rates to 0%. Now when I used to work at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank many years ago, the key text that we were schooled on was a book called the history of interest rates by Sydney Homer, who was uh an early head of research at Salman. And that book cataloged 4,000 years of interest rate history. Nowhere in those pages do you ever read about zero interest rates. So the situation that we've come through in the last 15 years have been absolutely unique in human history and that just you know underscores what an anomaly we've had. During that period of zero interest rates, debt was termed out. In other words, uh borrowers who were sitting on large interest rate loans uh that were upcoming in the next two or three years decided they'd refinance them and then push that refinancing back uh into the latter part of the uh of this decade, the 2020s. And if you look at the graph, you'll see that the orange line is starting to shoot up and it tests that broken line threshold uh sometime in 2026 27 and that is basically saying that we're moving into a much tighter liquidity framework because more debt has to be refinanced. This chart illustrates that change in the annual debt role on our estimates. The bite out of the chart in 2122 23 was the response to zero interest rates when debt was termed out to the back end of the decade. The darker red bars are showing our estimates of the amount of debt that's coming back. And this is not the level, this is the change in the level. So these are increments of extra debt that has to be refinanced. If you get a problem in the repo markets, you'll start to see repo spreads blowing out. And this is the repo spread against Fed funds. Now, if this is a barometer or even if you like a a sort of a heart monitor uh of the system, you'll see that we're starting to get some pretty scary readings coming out. And the point to note is not necessarily the spikes, the scale of them, but the frequency. Because what this is saying is you've got increasing tensions. Now we understand fully that you know repo markets tighten at the end of each quarter and they need liquidity. But the point here is that you've got a trend and what's happened in the last week uh is you've seen uh spikes in repo. You've seen the Fed's standing repo facility which is an emergency financing tranch being used quite heavily twice. And you've had um J Pal the Fed chair uh de facto announce on Tuesday that quantitive tightening was ending um and disjin the dots here. Um there there are problems with liquidity in the system. It's beginning to roll over and you can see this evidenced in the chart. Um and that is what we've really got to be very very alert to. The system needs more liquidity. The bottom line is that simply ending QT is not enough. Uh they're going to have to do a lot more than that. Now, this is the other thing which we need to monitor and this may be the dog that hasn't barked yet in sort of shower comms terms. Uh this is move volatility. Uh it threatens to spike upwards uh if you get bigger problems in the repo and bond markets. It hasn't yet. It's beginning to lift off a little bit, but I think the authorities are keeping this under under a lid. So, they're massaging it downwards as best they can. But, nonetheless, this is something which is needs watching. Although I it hasn't moved yet. This is the growth of Fed liquidity prospectively and this is showing what is likely to happen to Fed liquidity over the course of the next six months. Now, Fed liquidity was an aggregate we devised back uh in well in in the late uh late 2010s to try and understand uh what the Federal Reserve was really doing in terms of liquidity injections. The balance sheet wasn't really good enough as a measure uh through this QEQT phases and you needed a more precise aggregate which we devised Fed liquidity. Fed liquidity can be estimated by everybody from the weekly uh 4.1 uh 84.1 press release that is uh delivered by the Federal Reserve at 4:30 Eastern time every Thursday. Um we show it here. This is the growth rate. We've projected it into 2026. Uh you can see that what has h what is happening prospectively is a significant shortfall in liquidity. In other words, it falls absolute drops. Uh the previous two times that it did that was not very good for markets and that's what we got to be alert to. But even if uh the Federal Reserve stopped its QT policy, that orange line would still decline. It would see probably half the decline that you've got there, but it certainly wouldn't go positive. And that's one of the things to be alert to. What are the risks of this? This is the risks that we need to be also very alert to. and up to speed on this is looking at the movement in excess reserves of US banks. This is based on our calculation of what excess reserves are. We think that the adequate reserve level for US banks is about $3.3 trillion. Uh the Federal Reserve thinks it's about 2.7, so about half a trillion less. Uh we think we're right. Uh we think they're wrong. Um the markets are telling uh the Fed it's wrong. Um the orange line is where excess reserves or deficient reserves sit. So currently uh we're looking at a figure of about uh close to 300 uh billion below our our estimates um uh of adequate and it lines up exactly with trade fails among primary dealers. Now if you get an increase in trade fails, I should say that that scale is the right one and it's shown inverted. If you get an increase in trade fails, uh you're going to risk higher volatility in the bond markets. The move index moves up, repos spike, and more and more uh dealer banks go to the Fed's standing repo facility and try to try to get cash. And this is really the issue that we've got. Markets are in a slow motion uh car crash and we've got to be watchful to see that the Fed does something. Now, what does it mean for risk assets like equities? This chart may give some insight into what's going on. The uh red line is our estimate of Fed liquidity. So, this is the aggregate that we've created uh from the balance sheet. It's the liquidity generating elements of the balance sheet. Uh this is how it's moved over time uh since the early 2000s. You can see really what's been going on. uh it was you know difficult to see what was what was operating pre uh 2008 but I'd have to say that most of the driver of markets pre208 was private banks um um through you know excessive lending or whatever leveraging uh what it is now has really been uh central banks have been the the main source of liquidity and if you look at the durations in the red line you can see that they broadly line up certainly with big moves uh in the S&P which is shown in orange. Now the S&P here has been lagged by 25 weeks. Okay, so almost half a year and this is showing uh the broad alignment between Fed liquidity and the S&P. So if you join the dots here, what you've got to say is the S&P is vulnerable to some pullback uh based on the fact that the Fed is taking liquidity out. Now there are two ways to go with this thesis. One is to say, \"Oh, whoops. it's an accident and we're going to be uh seeing a lot of liquidity coming back into the market soon. Uh I would be hesitant to draw that conclusion because uh messes Bessant Miran and Powell uh the key figures uh in among US policy makers all saying they don't want any more QE because it's an unfair uh way of stimulating the economy. They want more directed uh spending and that's why the fed the sorry a big button that's why the treasury is issuing lots of treasury bills and focusing that spending on the real economy through defense procurement uh stakes in companies uh you know buying essential minerals this sort of thing so I think it'll be slow coming the other thing which is an even more or the other route which is an even more cynical view is actually they want this by design because if they create a a sell off of risk assets, it will force everyone back into the treasury market and the treasury market is really the main source of funding obviously for government spending. Now that may be too cynical but never say never because policy makers have done that in the past. So that's principally the story of what's happening in the US financial markets and Anthony I can pause here to see if you've got some questions or what I can do is to go uh on to what I think is happening in China which is maybe a different story. Yeah, that'd be great because that's where I was going to ask. You know, it's uh seems like there's sort of lots of liquidity coming out of China, but maybe you can uh provide more context there. So, this is looking at the debt liquidity ratio of Japan and China. Now, I'm just going to go back in the presentation because you need to contrast this with the earlier slide here. Now this earlier slide was for all advanced economies and this is dominated by the US clearly by by its size and to some extent by the Euro zone but uh let's say it's non-Asian economies which are which are really dominating that picture and if we go back to the Asian picture what you can see is that Japan uh had a very high debt liquidity ratio back in 2005 onwards for about you know by 8 years. Don't worry about the levels of the debt liquidity ratio that really reflects um the average maturity of debt in these economies and that would differ by uh economic structure. But it's the history that really is important and what this shows is that Japan was struggling under a very high debt liquidity ratio. They found it difficult to refinance. That was a that was saddling their economy. and what they've done since that time through abonomics, if people remember that, and abomics will likely be taken up by the new prime minister in uh Japan. Now, um that devalued debt by printing lots of money, allowing the yen to devalue significantly and essentially Japan's debt burden was eased significantly. and that came via the Bank of Japan's very aggressive quantitive easing program. China is in a similar situation. Chim China looks like Japan did 15 years ago and China is operating very much the same policy. What you're seeing is China starting to expand liquidity quite aggressively. Uh it's beginning uh to print money. Uh it's trying to devalue the yuan. Uh you can see the evidence of that in Japan's financial markets. Uh the stock market's zooming higher. Um the bond market is selling off, yields are rising, all symptomatic of this expansion. And the yuan is devaluing principally against gold. This is the scale of that liquidity injection. You can see that the People's Bank of China, the the central bank there has injected uh over this is a rolling six-month change uh something like six uh trillion yuan uh into markets uh on a six-month rolling basis. Uh in fact over the last 12 months that adds up to or scales up to about 7 to 8 trillion and that is equivalent to about1 trillion US dollars. Um given the comparison between China now and America in the GFC um America put in about 22 2.5 trillion to bail out the system. Then China will have to do probably the equivalent. So you're looking at something like an at least the same again of monetary injection by China. What is the vent for that? Um it's as I said uh it's rising asset prices. One of the things that I think China would definitely want to do is to get the level of residential real estate prices up which have been on the doldrums because that really is uh you know Chinese people's long-term pension funds um and that will need to be uh uh underpinned and you can see here the devaluation of the yuan. Now probably as we speak this is uh out of date because the gold price keeps going up in yuan and dollar terms but I think it's China driving the world gold market not anyone else and China is buying gold aggressively. Uh we're told they bought 700 tons at least 700 tons last year. They produced themselves about 375 tons of gold. So they're accumulating gold at something like a thousand tons a year. Uh estimates would suggest that China has probably top side 5,000 ounces maybe as little as three but somewhere between three and five we don't know America officially has eight 8,000 ounces and therefore within at this rate within three four years uh China is going to surpass America's gold stock uh that I think is a psychological uh fact or of import and this basically says that China's actions are pushing the gold market higher. Why does China want this? Because I think China is backing its currency with gold to some extent. It's not a gold standard, but it's a gold content system and that is very much in their interests and it makes the Chinese yuan a lot more attractive to trade with. uh particularly if you're another commodity producer uh be it a Brazil or a Saudi because you're probably quite happy to have your goods priced in yuan if there's that gold backing because you know that the yarn yuan is going to be underpinned. So effectively what they're doing is they're doing gold for oil or gold for uh commodity swaps uh with China under this regime. So this is the mechanism that we've got. China is in a very different situation. China is pumping liquidity. America is stumbling or stuttering in terms of liquidity. Uh we've got to see the, you know, the color of the Fed's eyes here as to what they're really doing. Uh I think that they've made an error. I think they're going to be slow to address that error just by simple institutional uh inertia. Uh and I think we've all got to be very alert being, you know, investors in risk assets uh about what the near term looks like. Um so, you know, watch this space. >> Yeah, really interesting. And do you see sort of cycles maybe speeding up because I think it's something we've seen. There's just so much volatility in the markets. There's so much um you know price action moves extremely quickly. So do you think this is something that could sort of be um a few months and then resolved or do you see this more as it will take a bit longer for liquidity to come back into the market? Well, I think the I mean the point that I think we'd make is that if you you know if you go back and look at the track of the liquidity cycle historically, I mean it's never as smooth uh you know as as we'd like it to be, you can see that those peaks tend to be a little bit jagged. Uh you know what's more often the case is the trough is very sudden and spikes up uh quickly. But I think that you know if you look at this uh the evolution of this and bear in mind this is not just the US it's everybody it's possible to see a gradual roll over in this index that's for sure and that may in the immediate stages not be that painful but you know as you rightly say markets uh are very fast to react these days they're very sensitive to small changes in liquidity and the risk is with this sort of inflection you could be seeing a sudden drop in markets which go on to discount uh a coming slump in liquidity. So the liquidity cycle is a bit like a super tanker. It takes time to get going and it takes time to slow down. And you know, I would still say that I think it's very likely uh that we get some sort of downswing in liquidity and that would broadly mean that we're in for a period where bond markets may begin to outperform. >> Yeah. Okay. Really interesting. And if we go to, you know, you mentioned Scott Bessant and his focus on sort of, I guess, the main street versus Wall Street. Do you see a scenario because from their perspective, I imagine they want sort of ideally they want wall street to benefit as well as main street. So is is that possible? I think if you look at, you know, share it's okay if equities go up, but the concern would be if property prices and if other real assets which are required in life continue to go up, then you sort of price out the younger generation. So you see a mechanism where they can actually somehow keep liquidity running add QE while keeping the stock market going without Yeah. >> Well, I think that's I think all those things are diff that's a difficult call uh for sure. Um if you take a look at this chart, this is showing the change in the bias of policy stimulus in the US. Now what this is showing is all forms of liquidity stimulus that go into the markets. So the red dark red area is straightforward QE by Federal Reserve. That's balance sheet expansion. In other words, that's normal open market operations. The orange area is what we've labeled not QEQE. Now that is the more subtle element of sort of Sula Tambler uh deals, which are not headline operations, but things that are more subtle, but they get liquidity into the system um you know through the back door or whatever. Uh and that is things like you know the bank term funding program, the reverse repo tranch, um things like the operating losses the Fed is making uh things like movements in the Treasury general account. All those factors are the orange line, the orange area and then the black is the change in treasury policy in terms of funding. So this is changing the tenor of funding. uh in other words shifting the calendar towards treasury bills and very shortdated debt and away from longerdated coupons like 10 or 20 year coupons. So this is basically suggesting that what you've got here is a liquidity expansion because of the big bill increase in bills as that black area. Uh you can see that that is the dominant part of stimulus through 2026. Stimulus is not going away. I mean it's interesting to note that if you look at those cycles uh the period uh from maybe early 2025 uh was seeing a dip in that space of that stimulus and that may well attest to the economy being soft right now or having a soft spell. So it could well be that the real economy picks up. And the point I'm really making here is that, you know, you we can debate where the orange and the red tranches of liquidity go, and they probably almost certainly go into the financial markets, but the black areas tend to go into the real economy. And you know what you've got here is in terms of the net bias, uh there's a lot more liquidity going into the real economy. Now this may well help uh ease the wealth divide but it comes at a cost of the financial markets and I think it's very difficult for uh Scott Bess and etal to ride two horses at once. So I think they either want the real economy going or they want the financial markets going and you know the point that I've frequently made is that you know all money that's anywhere must be somewhere. Okay, if it's in the real economy it's not in financial markets. if it's in financial markets, it's not in the real economy. Uh unless the Federal Reserve is really being aggressively generous, and I don't see that. So, I think that if the real economy is picking up, and I would venture that's what we're going to get in 26, despite the doom and gloom among a lot of economists, I think that 26 could be a much better year for the economy. Um it isn't necessarily going to be a better year for the financial markets. >> Okay. Yeah. Really interesting. So, Michael, thanks so much for your time today. appreciate uh you know we've we've covered so much but uh my last question is what is one message you want people to take away from our conversation. >> Well I think the um I think the main message is that liquidity really does matter. It's important to understand um what's going on with the dynamics of global liquidity where we are in the cycle because this is really the asset allocation cycle and if you want more granular information I mean you can either come directly to us and u you know we publish um capital wars which is on Substack uh which is a uh a three or four times a week publication which goes to all these all this information. Uh we have an institutional service of course as well which uh provides data uh full data for a lot of clients institutional clients on what's happening to liquidity. Uh but if you also want to do it yourself uh then take a look at things like uh the H4.1 that the Federal Reserve publishes every uh Thursday afternoon uh Eastern time. Uh that's you know that's where we get a lot of the data that you saw today from uh but we analyze that data obviously in pretty pretty intensively uh in our analysis but it's there it's published uh you people could do it but you've just got to watch what's going on in the repo markets because that's the that's the headline story today. >> Great great message. So thanks again and yeah as you said Capital Wars is probably one of the best places to find you Crossber Capital. Is there anywhere else that people can find your work? Well, you can you can go to our website and you can find uh more information about um uh our institutional services, but that's much more uh you know intensive research and data provision and whatever. And we have you know API feeds uh which basically deliver our indexes and data to quantum or uh actually whoever wants it. >> Great. I'll put in below but thanks again for your time. >> Great pleasure Anthony. Good to see you. Thank you.", "language": "en", "title": "Liquidity Shortage Squeezing the Economy with Michael Howell"}
