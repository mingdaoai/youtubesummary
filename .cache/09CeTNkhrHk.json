{"transcript": "all right we're going to do a Northwest registered agent review here but before we get started there are affiliate links in the description below that I get a commission on when you use my links and I don't want you to use my Northwest link all right and the reason I'm so frustrated making this review is my background is marketing and in marketing there is just so much scumbag stuff that happens all right and it makes me so annoyed and frustrated with marketers and the profession that I still believe that I am in right now all right and what I'm going to show you here is what I like to call Black Friday pricing all right we've all seen this you go up for a Black Friday type sale they're like oh this is $179 special price $129 and you peel back the sticker the original price is $129 to me this is gross and we're going to call this Black Friday pricing what you can see here is two different prices once I got into my account of actually registering in LLC with Northwest and here we have a $50 package what that is is the state filing fee in this case was Colorado was $50 and then you can file it yourself for free now what that means is when you go through um their process and you click in the services up here form an LLC and you start picking out things like Colorado and then you go here I started filling this out and what it's doing is filling out In Articles of organization that's the actual document that you create and send to the state to file your LLC but you can also hire them and then just for $9 plus State fee they'll get everything set up for you but I believe what happened is is when you just continued to file the articles of organization you open up your account they're telling us right here that you can download the form mail it yourself get it back upload it into your account and it's $50 for that state fee so I'm just like well that's not really a service and the reason I say that is all the other top LLC Services out there busy Legal Zoom Zen business Taylor Brands Inc Authority go down the list they all have a $0 plus State fee package and they actually send the form for you so the analogy here is imagine that there are five auto mechanics in your town and all of them are offering free oil changes four of them you show up they change your oil for free and then what they're going to do is try to upsell you they say hey your wiper blades are need to be replaced also your brake pads and rotors look like they're worn out we should replace those and maybe you want a tire alignment that is how those free plus upsell Services work that is a Perfect Analogy if I don't mind saying so myself for LLC Services because there's Zar Plus St fees but there's a ton of upsells all right so then it's up to you to decide which upsells you want but Northwest registered agent here for this file yourself is like if you went into the mechanic and they said hey here's the type of oil you need go home buy the oil put it in your car come back and we'll put the sticker in the windshield to let you know when you need to re uh renew your oil all right and I say renew because each date you have to to renew your LLC in my opinion all the other services they will do it for you they will file it for you and this service they're making you do it and then saying it's free but here's where it gets worse all right again let's go back to Black Friday pricing all right there is the option here for a complete package and if you look at the tiny print down here they say our fee is 100 State fee is 184 that is just a bold lie all right like this is where I get so frustrated because this is a marketer that's like hey this looks better if we tell them our fee is 100 and the state fee is 184 because they do have our fee for 100 and then they have registered agent service fee is 125 registered agent is in the name it's Northwest registered agent that is not a state fee that is a $125 that is going to Northwest registered agent all right then they have a $0 renewal service which is pretty cool actually uh if you're not familiar you need to renew your LLC in your state each year there's still going to be a state filing fee and those can range they're like $10 to $100 I've seen them more than that um but they're saying they will renew it for free and then a $9 beneficial ownership information report um really important we're going to talk about that later in this video I'm going to take a breath here because I think I'm getting kind of angry in this review um but then the other interesting thing is I can't even proceed without adding the expedited $50 so that's what brings this to 284 so what this should say say is at the bottom it should say our fee is $234 and then the state fee is 50 but that doesn't sound as good so somebody wrote up some copy and basically lied here all right but this gets worse all right if you were to use my link um setting up your LLC you would get to a page that looks like this in my link it would be $39 but the registered agent fee is zero and the filing fee is zero and then it's total of $89 all right way better deal again again in my own account I can see this for $284 and then with my affiliate link you can see that this would be $89 so why not use my affiliate link well here is a company called truck another affiliate marketing website and they have a deal struck up with them where it's $29 and then you also get a free operating agreement so they have different affiliate deals for different Affiliates so somebody else's link you could use would be $10 cheaper and you'd get the operating agreement for free now the things that you need to know here though is what is that registered agent service after the first year if you're not familiar registered agent third party service that handles important documentation and communication for your business so like let's say you get sued uh what they're going to do is they're going to make sure you get your service of process notice and that you're showing up to court and doing all the things you need to do dotting your eyes crossing your tees so it's important but that's going to renew at $125 per year all right now where this also gets interesting is if we look at other services out there why don't we take a look look at a service called busy which was formerly known as ink file now when you go through there if I was to pick LLC Colorado start my business what you can see here is they have a $0 starting select package and that includes the free registered agent service for a year which renews at $19 which is $6 cheaper than Northwest but the other thing is they give you the option to add on the expedited filing for 50 bucks if you can recall when we looked at the other page here I could not figure out a way here when I click on this to continue forward without adding the $50 option here for expedited filing so when you're taking a look at Northwest registered agent it to me it's a very frustrating thing because I have found three different pricing models and that's because they're testing different things out and they're trying to figure out how they can extract the most money from you the actual end consumer but when you use a service like bsy which again I have a link for in the description below which is an affiliate link it starts at $0 and then things are actually just add-ons and it's up to you if you want to add it on granted yes there's a $40 operating agreement that they would charge you for if you wanted to add that but it's still going to end up working out cheaper because all the renewal services are cheaper going forward now the last thing I want to talk about um in this video though is this $9 beneficial ownership information report what is that exactly well I give Northwest Credit I have seen other services charging $2 $300 for this which is a complete ripoff what you need to do is this is the IRS website right here and you can get to this by just searching searching beneficial ownership information you'll get the.gov website right here and then what you're going to do is you're going to file all right and then you can file it right here all right and then what I would recommend is filing it on the web what this actually is is the IRS is concerned about foreign investors hire like filing llc's and they're using kind of the shell game within the United States buying up land all this stuff so they're doing this census to get information on who you actually are what's the LLC actually about but you can go through this report yourself which I have done on the web and it's not that hard it takes about 5 minutes so I will give Northwest uh some props that they're only charging n bucks but you could definitely do this yourself as well um last thing I want to mention too is if you do use one of my affiliate links below we actually donate $20 to charity on your behalf currently we're partner with crisis Services of West New York um that $20 goes towards the people that work there that answer the phone calls for people in a moment of Crisis we make sure that they are being taken care of so that means like company lunches um that means updating their Wellness room we're looking at buying a massage here and doing different things up to this point we've already donated $114,000 in 2024 because of people like you using our affiliate links a lot of stuff that you had to digest here in this review um but what I would say is I'm going to have a video on the screen that'll pop up eventually when I have actually gone through and purchased an LLC through all the top services so you'll see that video right here when that's available but in the meantime you can actually see a review of busy and what the backend dashboard looks like and I am actually readed in the face from making this video for the first time time because I'm so frustrated with just trying to make this review so hopefully this was helpful and I'll catch you in the next video and again I appreciate you using our affiliate links in the description below but don't use mine for Northwest it's not worth it for you all right I'll catch you in the next video", "language": "en", "title": "Honest Northwest Registered Agent Review (An Actual Honest Review for once)"}
