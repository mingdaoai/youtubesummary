There's all this like tooling and
infrastructure still to build. There's
clearly still a bunch of startups yet to
be built in just the infrastructure
space around deploying AI and using
agents. If you're living at the edge of
the future and you're exploring the
latest technology, like there's so many
great startup ideas, you're very likely
just bump into one. You apply the right
prompts and the right data set and a
little bit of ingenuity, the right eval,
a little bit of taste and you can get
like just magical
[Music]
output. Welcome back to another episode
of the light cone. every other week.
We're certainly realizing there's a new
capability, a million token context
window in Gemini 2.5 Pro. It's just
really insane right now. And the thing
to take away from that though is that we
have an incredible number of new startup
ideas, some of which are actually very
old and they can only happen right now.
Harj, what are some of the things you're
seeing? Well, one thing I've been
thinking a lot about recently is what
are types of startup ideas that couldn't
work before AI or didn't work
particularly well that are now able to
work really really well. Uh and one idea
that is very personal to me um would be
recruiting startups since I ran a
recruiting startup triple bite for
almost 5 years. And I think um something
that I've clearly seen is that there was
a period of time when we started Triple
Bites around 2015 where recruiting
startups were kind of like a really
popular type of startup. Um and I think
a lot of the excitement around those
ideas back then was this idea of
applying marketplace models to
recruiting because there were
marketplaces for everything except how
to hire great people and specifically
great engineers. And we started Triple
Bite with the thesis of you don't just
want to let anyone on your marketplace.
You want to build a really curated
marketplace that evaluates engineers and
gives people lots of data about who the
best engineers are. And this was all
prelim. So we had to spend years
essentially building our own software to
do thousands of technical interviews to
squeeze out every little data point we
could from a technical interview so that
we'd effectively build up this label
data set that we could run machine
learning models on. But we didn't even
get to do that until like years three or
four. And initially it was uh actually a
three-sided marketplace and that you
needed to hire an interviewer in between
to get that human. We had companies
hiring engineers, we had the engineers
looking for jobs and then we had
engineers we contracted to interview the
engineers. Um so there's like lots of
things going on right now. Um and all of
the evaluation piece of it at least now
with AI is very very possible. I mean we
can specifically with the AI codegen
models you can do code evaluation um and
I think probably one of the hot AI
startups at the moment is this company
called Meror which is essentially
similar to the triple bite idea. It's a
marketplace for hiring software
engineers. Um but I think what AI has
unlocked for them is the evaluation
piece of it they could just do on day
one using LLMs. that they need to build
up this big label data set and they've
been able to expand into other types of
knowledge work um quite easily. For us
to have gone from like engineers to
analysts to all these other things would
have taken years because again we had to
rebuild the label data set. Um but with
LLMs you can just do that on you know
day one effectively. And so I think this
whole this whole class of recruiting
startups that are trying to evaluate
humans at being good at specific tasks
or not um is a really interesting space
that's much more exciting to find good
startup ideas in now than it was 5 years
ago. So that's a very powerful prompt
for anyone listening. Uh what are
marketplaces that are three-sided or
four-sided marketplaces that suddenly
become, you know, two or three-sided or
now there are two-sided marketplaces
like Dolingo that are, you know, a
little bit under fire because they're
sort of starting to say actually maybe
we're just going to use AI for uh the
person that you're going to talk to in
another language. That is totally a
coherent thing that you could go to
almost any marketplace in the world and
say what if what what will uh LLMs do in
that marketplace? I think the other
thing I really respect the Merkel
founders for is there's also just a
psychological element as a founder to
when you enter into a space where
there's um been lots of smart teams and
lots of capital that's flown into it.
This was definitely with recruiting
startups. I mean Triple Bite raised
something like $50 million. our main
competitor hired, raised over a hundred
million. I think in aggregate hundreds
of millions of dollars went into funding
recruiting marketplace companies. Um,
and overall as a category did not do
particularly well. And so I think going
in you face a lot of skepticism if
you're going to go out and pitch
investors for an idea. Even when you
have the like, well, LLM's change
everything, that pitch two years ago was
still not as compelling as it is today.
And so you have to be willing to sort of
push through a lot of sort of cynicism
and people who are burnt out, who have
lost lots of money on an idea to even
kind of keep going to test it out and
and make it work. That's something that
repeats actually all the time. I mean,
Instacart was that story. Exactly. Like
Web Van was sort of this rotting corpse
of a startup just hanging in that
doorway and most people looked at that
and said, "Oh man, I I don't want to
walk near that." Like there's there's
going to be more. But, you know,
simultaneously the iPhone and uh Android
phones were everywhere and you could
have a mobile marketplace for the first
time. And I guess that's why we're
pretty excited about this moment because
suddenly all you know the idea maze just
moved like all of the walls to the idea
maze have shifted around and uh the only
way to find out is you've got to
actually be in the maze. It is very
similar
to Instacart and Web Van if we go back
in history, right? because like the the
big technology unlocked for Instacart
was the fact that everyone had a phone
now. It enabled like the webband model
to actually work for the first time. And
like it's the same thing with LLMs and
recruiting companies now and and a whole
bunch of other ideas. I think it makes
uh focusing even on specific parts of
the marketplace to be great ideas to
start with. even with this uh recruiting
idea space. This is company called
Apriora that Nico, the other GP here at
YC funded back in winter 24 and their
whole premise is to build AI agents that
run the screening for technical
interviews where a lot of engineers
spend a lot of time just doing a bunch
of interviews and the pass rate is so
tiny. When I used to run engineering
teams at Niantic, all that pre-screening
was just so much work. The engineers
hate doing it. Yeah. And even that one
piece not exactly let's say marketplace
or what is the hardest part of it and if
you solve it right now it works out. So
API actually does a pretty good job.
It's being used by large companies and
it's been taking off. It's another
example where you can actually expand
the market because I think the there are
plenty of technical screening products
pre-appora but you could only use them
to do fairly simple evaluations to like
weed out people who weren't engineers at
all um effectively um or very very
junior but a prior product now with LLMs
you can do more sophisticated
evaluations to kind of get more nuanced
levels of screening and so suddenly now
companies will be like oh actually I
could actually give this to not just
like my international applicants or my
college students. I'll just give it to
like senior engineers who are applying
which just opens up the opportunity. So
you were talking a bit about education
as well Gary about Dualingo. I think
that's aspect of doing
hyperpersonalization is one of the holy
grails where has been difficult for
edtech companies to crack right because
every student as they go through their
learning journey everyone is very unique
and knows different things and it sounds
really cool to build like the awesome
personal AI Twitter that we did a that
harsh did an RFS for right yeah the
thing I'm excited about is for as long
as I can remember the internet's been
around like one of the like um dreams of
it was that everyone now have access to
like personalize learning and knowledge
and um we'd all just
um you know have these like great
intellectual tools to learn anything and
clearly the internet's made it easier to
learn but we've never had really truly
personalized learning or personalized
tutor in your pocket idea which is
possible now for the first time and I
think we're definitely seeing smart
teams applying to YC who are interested
in building that type of product. Couple
companies that we funded that are kind
of working out is uh this other company
that also Niko funded called Revision
Dojo that helps students do exam prep
and is sort of the version of uh
flashcards but not like the janky just
like boring going through content but
the version that actually students like
and gets tailored for their journey. And
that one has like a lot of DAUs and a
lot of power users which is super
interesting. And I think Jared you had
work with this other company called
Adexia as well. Yeah. Um Adexia does
tools for teachers to grade their
assignments which is another example of
work that like is like not people's main
job but is this other thing that they
have to do like engineers doing like
recruiting that they generally hate
doing. There's like a lot of studies
that show that like the biggest reason
that teachers churn out of the workforce
is that they hate grading assignments.
It's just like no fun at all. And so
Adexia like is an agent that's like very
good at helping teachers to grade
assignments. Yeah. One of the
interesting trends for some of this
stuff is that um it's private schools
who are actually much more nimble and
you know I'd be curious what policy
changes we need to make to actually
support this in public schools cuz the
public schools need it the most
actually. I guess question for you
actually Gary I'm curious about this
stuff is it's clearly possible to build
much better products with LLMs if we
take the the learning apps for example
they can go far beyond anything you
could do for personalized learning
prelims um but it doesn't necessarily
mean that you instantly get more
distribution especially if you're going
after the consumer market so do you how
do you think that plays out do better
products automatically get more
distribution or will these startups have
to work equally as hard to get
distribution to be big companies as
before. I guess one of the more awkward
things that's still true is that um you
know intelligence is much cheaper. It's
quite a bit cheaper than it was last
year, but it's still enough that you
have to charge for it probably. Um but
that's something I would probably track.
I mean it seems clear that um you know
distillation from bigger models to
smaller models is working. It seems
clear that the mega giant models are
teaching even the production model size
of today to be smarter. The cost of
intelligence is coming down quite
significantly. So, you know, I know that
we tease this sort of uh almost every
other episode, but like consumer AI, it
finally might be here soon. Uh and I
think the thing to track is well how
smart is it such that like any given
user incrementally only costs I don't
know pennies or like 10 or 15 cents like
then it becomes so cheap that you will
just have intelligence for free. Maybe
it'll be a return to the premium model
that we got used to during web 2.0. this
idea that you could basically give away
your product and then for um you know
five or 10% of those users there are
things that they so want that you know
you're going to sell them a5 or $10 or
$20 a month subscription that's
basically what open AI is doing right
like that is they complexity does it
open AI uh you know going back to
education study with 2DS they're doing
it and they're seeing a lot of success I
mean on average the kids who use that
actually get on grade level or, you
know, can kind of go up uh even a couple
grade levels. Those are real outcomes
for students. So, you know, right now
you still got to pay for it, but uh
maybe not for a while. And that's
actually a really big unlock. You know,
that that's the moment where you could
have 100 million or a billion people
using it. OpenAI uh might be furthest
ahead with it. But the hope is that, you
know, really thousands of apps like this
start in start coming out. um across all
the different things you'll need. And
that's something that I know we keep
saying it like it's gonna happen. I mean
it's kind of happening already for
edtech speak. It's this company that got
started couple of years ago before LLMs
were a thing at all. It was team of
researchers that really believed that
you could personal personalize language
learning which might have been a bit
contrarian back then because Duolingo
seemed to be the game in town that was
winning and they really focus on really
personalizing that whole language
learning and they got they started
taking off in Korea for a lot of uh
learners that were trying to learn
English and when GPT3 and 3.5 they were
early adopters of it started coming out
they saw that wow this is going to be
the moment they double down and they've
been on on this trajectory now with lots
of MAUs EAS that's really working out. I
think one thing going back to the
consumer thing that we haven't talked as
much about um we've seen a lot with the
startups that are selling to enterprises
or companies about how the budgets
become so much bigger when companies are
willing when companies stop thinking
about you as software as a service but
they start thinking about you as
replacing their customer support team or
their analytics team or something like
that. they'll just pay way way way more.
So the same thing will apply in
consumer, right? Like if you think about
a personalized learning app, uh often
edtech companies struggle with who's
actually the buyer and who's going to
pay. And if you go for like younger
children, for example, it's like you've
got to get the parents to pay. But the
parents aren't going to pay that much
for an app that their kids like don't
retain or complete like some sort of
online course that they're disengaged
with. But we know that parents will
definitely pay for like human tutors and
like you know that's like actually
probably quite a big market. And so if
your app goes from being like a
self-study course that doesn't get any
completion to actually being on par with
the best human math tutor for your
12-year-old, parents will pay a lot more
for that. And so those like it's
possible that like the product now just
become has a business model that you
didn't have before. And that alone means
you don't necessarily need millions of
parents using it, but even a hundred
thousand parents using it paying you a
significant amount means you now have
like a much bigger business than was
possible before. Yeah, I feel like we
have to talk about modes a little bit. I
mean, it's pretty clear a company like
Speak or almost any of these other
companies that could have durable
revenue streams like what you need is
brand, you need switching costs.
Sometimes it's integration with other uh
technologies that are sort of
surrounding that experience. like in uh
a school it would probably be being
connected to Clevver for instance like
login is authentication is pretty
obvious. So yeah I feel like Sam Alman
has talked about this a bunch you know
it's uh it's not enough to drop AI in it
you know you still have to actually
build a business I don't think open AI
is necessarily uh you know out to get
all the startups like I actually think
that on the API side they very much hope
that a lot of them do really really well
and certainly we want that too. They did
just hire like the Instacart CEO as
their CEO application. So, it does kind
of seem like they are definitely paying
more attention to the application layer.
That's right. Yeah. I mean, you'd be
crazy not to, right? Like, by all
accounts, Open AI is highly likely to be
a trillion dollar company at some point
and uh you know, as powerful as a Google
or an Apple or um any of them. The
interesting thing right now is like
they're still on the comeup. And then if
anything, um, the big tech platforms are
actually still holding back a lot of the
AI labs. And the most profound example
of this is, uh, why is Siri still so
dumb? It makes no sense, right? Totally.
Uh, I mean, I think that points to
something that we actually really need
in uh, tech today. We actually really
need platform neutrality. So in the same
way, you know, 20, 30 years ago, there
were all these fights about net
neutrality, this idea that there should
be one internet, that ISPs or big
companies should not self-preference uh
their own content or the content of
their partners. Uh you know, that's what
sort of unleashed this giant wave of
really a free market on the internet.
The other profound example of that is
actually Windows. if uh you know if you
open up Windows you actually have to
choose your browser and then you also
need to be able to choose which search
engine you use and these are things that
you know the government did get involved
in and said hey you you know you cannot
self-preference in this way and you know
if you remember the moment where where
internet explorer had a majority of web
users like that could have been a moment
where Google couldn't have become what
it became so We actually have a history
of the government coming in and saying
this should be a free market and for
that free market to create uh choice and
then therefore prosperity and abundance.
And so I would argue like, you know, why
doesn't this exist for voice on uh
phones? Like you should be able to pick
not you shouldn't be forced to use
Google Assistant. You shouldn't be
forced to use Siri. You should be
allowed to pick and you know it's been
many many years of having to use a very
very dumb Siri. On the moat topic,
something I just find fascinating is I
saw some numbers recently about how um
Gemini Pro models like just their usage
particularly from consumers is just a
insificant fraction of chat GPTs and I
think at YC we've been doing our own
internal work building agents and um
actually being at the cutting edge of a
lot of the AI tools and we found that
Gemini 2.5 Pro is like as good and in
some cases a better model than 03 for
various tasks that hasn't trickled down
into public awareness yet, right? Which
is fascinating since Google already has
all the users with their with their
phones. And I don't think anyone would
say OpenAI is not a startup anymore, but
relative to Google, it essentially is.
So there is clearly some sort of
intangible mode around being the first
in a space and sort of staking your
claim as like the best product for a
specific use case. And I feel like and
actually making it good. Yep. Yep. Yep.
Yep. But at some point, maybe it doesn't
even necessarily need to be like
objectively the best. It just needs to
be good enough. I mean, that's the bet
that I think a lot of the big tech
companies are trying and failing at. I
mean, there's Microsoft has a co-pilot
built into Windows now that is still
quite inferior to anything OpenAI puts
out. Gemini itself is very very good and
I use it quite a lot. Um it's probably I
don't know 40% of my agent you know sort
of if I need to especially summarize
YouTube videos it's very very good at
that for multimodal is really good.
Yeah, a lot of the Gemini integrations
into Gmail or, you know, Google Drive
are not they're totally useless. It's
like, is there someone at the wheel over
there? I don't get it. You know, I mean,
I think that's even confusing for us is
even using it as a developer. There's
actually two different products. There's
Gemini where you can consume Gemini and
Vert.ex Gemini. And I think they're like
different orgs. I think it's suffering a
little bit from being too big of a
company and essentially shipping the
orc. There's like these two APIs you can
consume to use Gemini and we're like why
two? One is from deep mind and the other
one is from GCP. I think that comes from
the culture of Google though. I mean
there's definitely this sense that uh if
two orgs are competing and fighting
normally in a normal org you go up and
in a functioning uh startup for instance
you know it goes up to some level and
then ultimately the CEO or founders and
then they just say okay well I see the
points over here I see the points over
there we're going this way but you know
having lots of friends from Google it
doesn't seem like that's the culture
there like there's a layer of VP and
sort of management that is actually like
you guys just fight it out and so then
you ship the org. I think the crazy
thing about Google, they probably should
have won a lot of the experience of the
best model. There's almost like I don't
know where all this Game of Thrones
analogy could be used. They might be a
little bit like Dennis Targaryen because
they secretly have dragons. The dragons
are the TPUs. Mhm. And this is one of
the reasons why I think they could be
the one company that could get a lot of
the cost of intelligence to be very low
and they also have the engineering to to
be able to do a cost effective large
context windows. I think one of the
reason why the other labs haven't quite
shipped as big of a context window is
cost actually. Is it actually the
hardware? like it's just like you can't
actually do it without
you can do it but I think it's just very
expensive and not cost effective but I
think they done it so well and they got
TPUs which I think is smart for Sam if
you saw his little announcement he's
still the uh CEO of compute quote
unquote so I'm sure they're probably
working on something around there too
classic innovators dilemma it's like if
Google replaced google.com with Gemini
pro it would instantly presumably be
like the number one chatbot LLM service
in the world, but that it would give up
80% of its revenue. Yeah, you would
probably need a pretty strong founder
CEO to do that. It's the kind of thing I
can imagine Zuck doing, right? Like
being will like Yeah, you just you can't
imagine a hired CEO who's going to do
that. He's done that. He renamed the
company to Meta. Yeah. Yeah. Meta has
its own issues, too. Like I'm so
surprised, you know? I mean, you have um
Meta's AI in WhatsApp. It's in the blue
app. It's everywhere. But I mean, who
actually uses it? I don't think any of
us. I started using the um meta AI in
WhatsApp. It's very
classic. It makes me feel like Zuck is
clearly still in charge of product
because I don't think anyone else would
launch it that way. You just you now you
have an AI system that's just in all of
your chats and you sort of it comes with
a you can just at it and it will just
start talking in a group chat and it
feels quite invasive actually. Is it
like well it's not that smart and then
it can't do anything. Yeah. And then you
have I mean most people are surprised
that it's in there. It's just it's just
like it feels like having someone from
Facebook just in your
chats and it's just like it's I know it
remind me of like the original newsfeed
launch or something. It's just like the
classic meta style of like this is sort
of I don't know objectively optimal like
I'm sure people will love it. You need
to add a little bit of design taste into
these things. I mean, it blows my mind
that I can go to the blue app, which I
still kind, you know, it's probably
people watching this are like, "What the
heck's the blue app?" This is like
facebook.com, which maybe nobody uses
anymore. It's very millennial. Yeah.
But, you know, you have this meta AI and
you ask it, "Hey, who are my friends?
I'm going to Barcelona next week. Who
are my friends in Barcelona?" And it's
like, "Sorry, as an AI, I actually don't
have access to them." It's like, what?
You know, what is the point of this?
Okay, our partner Pete Cuman wrote this
really great essay where he talked about
um the Gemini integration with Gmail and
he really like broke down in great
detail why Google built this integration
all wrong and how they should have built
it. Um it's almost like he was a PM at
Google. Oh wait, he he was a PM at
Google. Um it was very profound um in
that one of the things he pointed out
was that you know you have a system
prompt and a user prompt and if you are
actually going to empower your users you
actually allow your user to change the
system prompt which is the part that
normally is like above you know to use
the veniteshow's idea of like sort of
the the API line it's sort of like the
system prompt is
what is exerted upon it's like sort of
imposed upon the user and so you know
Gemini follows this very specific thing
I think the example is uh actually an an
email saying that uh Pete's going to be
sick to me he's like uh sorry I'm not
going to be able to come in and he asks
the agent to write this letter and it's
very formal and of course it is because
there's no way to change the tone it's
actually one the best blog post and that
I think he had to vibe code the blog
post itself cuz you can actually try the
prompts yourself on that web page. Yeah,
it's super cool. It's like a it's in
this like interactive Yeah. template
thing language which made me think it's
time to start an AI first vibe coding uh
blog platform. Oh, like a AI like a like
a AIosterous. Yeah, basically
isost Yeah. With all my extra time,
that's what I'm going to work on. But
that's a free idea for anyone's
watching.
we'll fund it. There's another class of
startup ideas that I'm I'm particularly
excited about that I think are like
perhaps the time is now, which is um do
you guys remember the tech- enabled
services wave? Yep. Yeah. So, for folks
who who who
uh didn't follow this, in the in the
2010s, there was this huge boom in
companies called tech- enabled services.
Um Triple Bite was one actually. Yeah,
that was like tech enabled services for
recruiting, right? Um we also had atrium
which was technical services for law
firms. It started with Balag's blog post
about full stack startups if you
remember like the concept was just that
um software eats the world means
software just kind of goes into the real
world and so this is not the success
example but an example of it was hey
like instead of just having an app to
deliver food you should also like have a
kitchen that cooks the food and software
to optimize the kitchen and you just do
everything. Um, and that like the full
stack startups in theory would be more
valuable than just the software startups
because they would do everything. Yeah.
Because instead of just selling like
software to like the restaurants and
capturing like 10%, you could just own
the restaurant, you could capture 100%.
This is exactly what TripleA was cuz we
were like we're going to be a recruiting
agency effectively. We're not selling
software to recruiting agency. We're
actually just doing the whole thing.
like we're gonna we also had recruiters
on staff that were just there to help
people negotiate salaries and match them
to the right companies and um yeah it
was very much in that wave of do
everything but the that wave of startups
generally forgot that you need gross
margins. Yeah. What happened like I mean
like fast forward basically the short
version is like it didn't really work
and the full stack startups actually
were not more valuable than the SAS
companies and the SAS companies sort of
like won that round of the like
Darwinian competition of different
business models. I think fundamentally
it's just what Gary says. It's just they
were actually not great gross margin
businesses, but it was actually I think
what it it was just hard to scale them.
At least in trip wise situation, we
actually got to like $20 million annual
run rate, $24 million annun rate within
a few years. So like if you compared us
to like a regular recruiting agency, it
was like super fast. But um if you
compare it to like the top software
startups, not that like um impressive
and it became harder and harder to scale
because you had more and more people.
Yeah. Yeah. Basically the margins didn't
work out particularly well and so then
you need to keep raising more capital
and so if you were like a fearsomely
good fundraiser, you could sort of do it
and kind of push yourself. But even in
those cases, I think most of those
businesses at some point it just caught
up with them. like at some point like
actually we have to figure out a way to
scale the business and have good margins
and make this like profitable and not
just rely on the next fundraising round
is what I felt hurt a lot of the you
could argue ZS was one of those for um
insurance and a bunch of different HR
related things. It was actually um they
basically relied too much on hiring more
salespeople and more customer success
people instead of actually building
software that then would create gross
margin. And so Parker Conrad said,
"Well, I'm not going to do that again.
And I'm also going to force all the
engineers to do the customer support so
that they go on to build software that
doesn't require so much support and thus
there is gross margin." And that, you
know, was a whole lesson that, uh, I
feel like the whole tech community
learned collectively through the 2010s.
If we learned one thing, it's gross
margin matters a lot. Like, you can you
cannot and should not sell $20 bills for
$10 cuz you're going to lose everything.
I think a sort of non-financial reason
why the gross margins matter is um, low
gross margin businesses usually mean you
have some ops component and then you
have to like run the ops component. So
if I think of my like tripey experience,
there was like a lot of brain power
spent on like how do we like manage this
team of like contracted engineers, this
team of like humans looking after the
like essentially the human recruiting
team like lots of pieces of the business
where actually the existential issue we
had is how do we get to like millions of
engineers across the world like all like
on like on our platform and all locked
in i.e. like how do you just get lots of
distribution? And I think something
that's nice about a high gross margin
business is another way of saying it's
just a simpler product or a simpler
company to run and you can actually just
spend all of your time focused in on how
do I make the product better and how do
I get more users and get more
distribution so that you can keep that
like exponential growth for a decade.
And I think a lot of full stack
startups partly plateaued out because
it's just a they're complex businesses
to run. Maybe u a very famous example of
that was like we worked right. Yeah.
Yeah. Which is very took it to the
limit. The margins were not there. It
was not uh didn't have the tech margins.
Right. It had community adjusted aida
which was
very creative. What I've been excited
about recently is like I think you can
make a bullc case that like now is the
time to build these full stack companies
because like you know like you were
saying like the triple by 2.0's knows
won't have to hire this huge ops team
and have bad gross margins. They'll just
have agents that do all the work. And so
like now actually like full stack
companies can look like software
companies under the hood for the first
time. And you gave a great example. So
Atrium started by Justin Khan, full
stack law firm didn't work out for all I
think a lot of these same reasons. Um
but now I heard him say that before.
It's like look, we went in trying to use
AI to automate large parts of it and it
wasn't the AI was not good enough at
that moment, but it's good enough now.
If you look at within YC, we have
Legora, which is like this like one of
the fastest growing companies we've ever
funded. Um, and it's not building a law
firm, but they're essentially um, you
know, building AI tools for lawyers, but
you can see where that's going to extend
out to, right? Like eventually their
agents are just going to do all of the
legal work and they'll they'll be the
biggest law firm on the planet. Um, and
yeah, I think that's a kind of full
stack startup that just wasn't possible
pre-LM. I think this started right when
Uber and Lyft and Instacart and all of
these companies were happening. And the
thing is now I mean you can actually
have LLMs do a lot of the knowledge work
and then I mean increasingly it it could
actually have memory. I mean this is one
of the RFS's. It's literally you can
have virtual assistants um but they
become less and less virtual if they can
also uh hire real people to do things
for you. Virtual assistant marketplaces
was definitely like a whole category of
companies for like 15 years in including
exec where you build like a marketplace
of like people in the Philippines and
like other other countries and then you
like exposed to sort of like Airbnb UI.
I don't think any of them ever like
really got really became like amazing
businesses though. Going back to Pete's
post, I think the other thing that's
interesting about the um the points he
made around sort of the system prompt
and user prompt and maybe we want to
expose the system prompt to users a
little bit more. Um it's an example of
just how we're still so early in just
using AIS and building agents. There's
all this like tooling and infrastructure
like still to build. You have to do
evals, you have to run the models, like
a whole bunch of stuff to build still.
And so there's clearly still a bunch of
startups yet to be built in just the
infrastructure space around you know
deploying AI and using agents and Jared
you know it's interesting something that
struck me about when I first came back
to YC in 2020 is I remember a class of
idea we weren't interested in funding
was anything in the world of like ML
machine learning operations or ML tools
and I remember reading some applications
and people like ah like another ML ops
like team like these sort of never go
anywhere. Um clearly if you were working
on ML ops in 2020 and you just stuck it
out for a few years, you're in the right
spot. Any context you can share from
that? I remember I got so frustrated
after years and years of funding these
ML ops companies with really smart,
really like optimistic founders that
just like didn't go anywhere that I ran
a query to count and I remember finding
that I think this was around 2019. We
had more applications in 2019 for
companies building ML tooling than we
had applications for like the customers
of those companies like like anyone
who's like applying ML to like any sort
of product at all. And like I think that
was the core problem is that like these
people were building ML tooling but
there was no one to sell it to cuz like
the ML didn't actually work. So there
just wasn't anything useful that you
could build with with with with all this
ML tooling. People didn't want it yet. I
mean directionally it was absolutely
correct. Like from a sci-fi level on a
10-year basis it was beyond correct.
Yes. It was just wrong for that moment.
Yeah. You actually have a team that
stuck it out. I mean part of the lesson
is sometimes it will take a bit of time
for technology to catch up and this
company called Replicate that you work
with stuck it out. It was from that era.
Yeah. Replicate was from winter 20 and
they started the company right before
COVID and during the pandemic it was
going so poorly that they actually
stopped working on it for several months
and just like didn't work on it cuz like
it wasn't clear that the thing like had
a future at all and then they picked it
back up and just started like working on
it quietly. But it basically was just
like they were just building this thing
in obscurity for two years until the
image diffusion models came out and then
it just like exploded like overnight.
OAM is another good example. Yeah, about
so the Olama folks were also from that
pandemic era and similar story to uh to
replicate. They were kind of trying to
do different things around here too and
they were trying to work it out to make
open source models deploy a lot better
and they were also quietly working on it
for a while. things weren't really
taking off and then suddenly I think the
moment for them was when Lama got
released that was like the easiest way
for any developer to run open source
models locally and it took off because
suddenly the interest to run models
locally just took off when things
started to work but not before that
because there were all these other open
source models um that were in hugging
face and especially the ones from like
BERT models those were like the more
used deep learning models. They were
like just okay, but not many people were
using them because they weren't quite
working. What's the moral of the story?
I mean, some of it is like uh be on top
of the oil well before the oil starts
shooting out of the ground, but is that
actionable? It's kind of the classic
startup advice of follow your own
curiosity. Like most of these teams or
almost all these teams were working on
it because they were just interested in
ML. They wanted to deploy models. They
were frustrated with the tooling.
probably weren't necessarily
commercially minded and trying to pick
the best startup idea they could
possibly work on. But I know sometimes
you get lucky sometimes. There's so many
ways to do it. I mean, we were just
sitting with Verun from Windsurf and he
pivoted out of MLOps into codegen.
Deepgram is another one. Um, Deepgram
was one of the first companies I worked
with back in 2016 and it was these two
physics PhDs. They had done string
theory. So they weren't even computer
scientists and they got interested in
deep learning because they saw like
parallels with string theory and they
were it was it was exactly what you said
Harge they they found the mathematics to
be elegant and interesting like that's
really the origin and so they started
working on deep learning before anybody
really and they built this speech to
text stuff and it just like didn't
really work that well for like a long
time and so like nobody really like paid
much attention to to this company wasn't
famous. The founders to their credit
just like kept working on it and then
when the voice agents took off, they all
needed speech to text and text to speech
and um most of them are actually using
deepgram under the hood and so they've
just like exploded in the last couple of
years. I mean I guess essentially the
whole AI revolution is built on
Ilioskava following his own curiosity
for like a long period of time. We need
more of that. Actually this is maybe a
meta point on this whole conversation.
So, um, we were at colleges, uh, Tyenne
and I went on this college tour, um, and
we spent several weeks speaking to
college students, and I realized that
there's this piece of startup advice
that became canon that I think is
outdated. Back in the pre-AI era, it was
really hard to come up with good new
startup ideas because the best like the
idea space had been picked over for like
20 years. And so a lot of the the
startup advice that people would hear
would be like you you really need to
like sell before you build. You have to
do like detailed customer discovery and
make sure that you've like found a real
like new customer need like the lean
startup lean startup. Yeah. Exactly.
Fail fast. All this stuff. And that is
still the advice that college students I
think are receiving for the most part
because it became so dominant. But I
would argue that in this new AI era that
the right mental model is closer to what
Hard said, which is just like use
interesting technology, follow your own
curiosity, figure out what's possible,
and like if you're if you're doing that,
if you're living at the edge of the
future, like PG said, and you're
exploring the latest technology, like
there's so many great startup ideas,
you're very likely to just bump into
one. I guess the reason why it could
work extra well today is that you apply
the right prompts and the right data set
and a little bit of ingenuity, the right
evals, a little bit of taste and you can
get like just magical output. And then
that's still a secret I think. Yeah, I
mean you can tell it's still a secret
because you could look at there like
hundreds of unicorns out there that
still exist and that are doing great.
You know, like growing year on year,
have plenty of cash, all of that. But
the number of them that are actually
doing any sort of like transformation
internally, it's not that many. like a
shocking few number of companies that
are you know 100 to thousand person
startups that you know they're going to
be great businesses but that class of
startup like by and large they are not
entirely aware like there isn't a skunk
works project in those things yet like
you know the extent of it is um maybe
the CEO is playing around with it like
maybe some of the engineers who are
really forward thinking are doing things
in their spare time with it maybe
They're using Windsor for cursor for the
first time and it's like you look down
and you're like what year is it? like
it's a little bit like hey you know get
on this like I think Bob Mcgru uh came
on our channel and he was just shocked
like he was one of the guys as chief
research officer like building you know
building what became 01 and 03 and all
these things and then he releases it and
like who's using it like he expected
this you know crazy you know outpouring
of like intelligence is too cheap to
meter this is amazing and it's like
actually like people are mainly just
we're just still on our quarterly road
map unchanged from, you know, even a
year ago. Yep. Pretty wild. Okay, cool.
I think that's all we have time for
today. My main takea away from this has
been there's never a better time to
build. So many ideas are possible today
that weren't even possible a year ago.
Um, and the best way to find them is to
just follow your own curiosity and keep
building. Thanks for watching. See you
on the next show.
