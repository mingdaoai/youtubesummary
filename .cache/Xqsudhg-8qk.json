{"transcript": "So there's a popular belief in Silicon\nValley of the best way to find startup\nideas is to try to solve your own\nproblems. But if everyone in the tech\nindustry is following that path, it\nleads to this saturation of problems for\nfolks in the tech industry. That's what\nled us to the insurance industry quickly\nrealized there's unsolved problems\neverywhere. People we reached out to\nearly on in the industry were quite\nskeptical. The f first thing I hear is,\nyou know, I just want to tell you, you\nknow, I'm taking this call as a favor,\nbut we don't need your services. We have\nsolved for this already. We're all set.\nI'm just trying to do this as a favor.\nAnd in retrospect, it's like, why would\nthey talk to two random outsiders?\nPeople are busy and hear pitches like\nthat all the time. We had that quote in\nour old office on the wall of that\nformative moment of we don't need your\nservices. And that company that told us\nwe don't need your services is now one\nof our largest customers.\nI'm Jordan. I'm the co-founder and CEO\nof Commulate. We're transforming the\ninsurance industry with AI. 3 years ago,\nit seemed crazy to most folks that we\nwanted to focus on the back office\ninsurance workflows. When you have like\ntwo people with no background in doing\nthe thing that they're saying they're\ngoing to be able to automate for you,\nwho the heck's going to take those those\npeople seriously? But since then, we've\nscaled to over eight figures of ARR and\nwe're just getting started.\nBy the time I I was in college, I was\nstarting to try to build software in a\nsoftware company and spend thousands of\nhours building actually one product in\nparticular. In reality, I realized as I\nwas going, I was building a huge\ndumpster fire. Platform had 500\nfeatures. is each of them was like 5%\nbuilt. Through that I realized like how\nactually complex it was to build great\nsoftware and I realized I think like I\nneeded to learn how to do that and I\nwanted to learn how to build great\nsoftware and I kind of came across and\nlearned about the role of product\nmanagement and I read this book\nparticularly called cracking the PM\ninterview that sort of several folks had\ntold me to read the author was Jackie\nwho ran product at a sauna it was like\n20 pages into it I was like I need to\nwork for for Jackie and that's how I\nended up going to a sauna with a mission\nof I want to learn how build great\nproduct from Jackie and then I ended up\nbeing able to learn from a lot of other\ngreat folk around that. I met my\nco-founder Michael towards the end of\ncollege. I was going to work in product\nat ASA and Michael reach out cuz he was\ninterested in in understanding what\nproduct was like. We met for lunch and\nit was one of those really one ina-\nmillion conversations where you meet\nsomeone and think like this person is\ndifferent. And it sounds pretty crazy,\nbut at that moment, I was actually\nalready thinking like, this might be\nsomeone I start a company with.\nUnfortunately, I think for me, Michael\ndidn't feel that way. He was going to\nthis company that no one knew about\ncalled Brex, and he was going to be the\n10th hire there. I'm Michael. I'm the\nCTO and co-founder of Commulate. I was\nan engineer at Brax uh prior. I joined\nthe company out of college when it was\njust about 10 people and saw it grow\nsuper quickly to over 900 during my time\nthere. Something the Bra founders are\nreally incredible at that I picked up on\nis being able to see the business at\nboth a 10,000 ft view and a 10-ft view.\nEven from the very beginning they were\nthinking about, hey, how do we scale\nthis to being 100 plus billion dollar\ncompany at some point and becoming like\nthe global substrate for financial money\nmovement. At the same time, they're\nextremely good at saying, hey, what\ngrowth hacks do we need to do this week\nto be able to push the company forward?\nYou know, what next feature do we need\nto build and what should be the design\nand product mocks to be able to do that?\nAnd those two skill sets, it's pretty\nrare to find in like the same person.\nAnd that's a big part of what I found to\nbe really successful in that early state\nis being able to do both. It was a\npretty incredible first job out of\ncollege. But also, I had always thought\nabout starting a company. Jordan and I,\nlike I mentioned, we were super good\nfriends and we had been talking about it\nmore and more over time. Jordan had just\nleft his job and it got to a point where\nwe were starting like nights and\nweekends to work on different startup\nideas together. All of these factors\nseem to come together. It said like,\n\"Hey, if there was a moment to do this,\nnow is definitely it.\" So, I leave Bra\nand jump right into starting a company\nwith Jordan.\n[Music]\nWhen Michael and I decided we're going\nto do this together, we actually like\ndidn't know anything about insurance or\naccounting. From our years at Asana and\nBrex, we had a few ideas that we were\nexcited about. But as we went through\nthe early process of validating those,\ntalking to the folks that we would try\nto serve and would be customers, the\nproblems that we thought were worth\nsolving weren't actually in practice,\nthey didn't feel as big as it seemed and\nand the existing solutions didn't seem\nas bad as we thought they were. And I\nthink Michael and I really got into the\nidea of wanting to build something that\ndidn't already exist. We had started\nlearning about insurance and we were\nimmediately stunned by the amount of\npaper, spreadsheets and time spent like\ncopying information from the analog\nworld to the digital world of very\nlegacy software and back in that we were\nreally especially fascinated by the\naccounting workflows. We saw that there\nwas you know many intermediaries and in\nthe value chain that sort of bubbled up\ninto this observation. This whole\nindustry has an additional extra version\nor extra type of accounting that other\nindustries don't have to deal with and\nthere's no good solutions that automate\nthat. Maybe we can develop that solution\nand that ultimately led to the kind of\nfoundation for commulate.\nPeople we reached out to early on in the\nindustry were quite skeptical. It was\nhard initially to like talk to people in\nthis industry and you relied on like the\nfew second or third degree connection\nyou would have to get a conversation and\nthen the first thing I hear is you know\nI just want to tell you you know I'm\ntaking this call as a favor but we don't\nneed your services we have solved for\nthis already. We're all set. I'm just\ntrying to do this as a favor. And at the\ntime that was a massive blow to us.\nWe're like oh wow like this is one of\nlike the largest companies into space.\nif they don't need this, like why would\nanyone else need it? But then as Baka\nstarted diving into it, talking to more\npeople, we kind of got the sense like,\nhey, he might just not be exposed to\nthis specific problem within his\ncompany. And we got more and more\nevidence many others actually did need\nour services. And what we spent a ton of\ntime on in the early days was just on\nZoom calls with our customers really,\nreally deeply understanding what they're\ndoing.\n>> And part of what helped us is we weren't\nsalespeople. We were product people like\ntrying to solve a problem and build a\nsolution for these folks. So our\nquestions usually were like very deep\nabout their workflows, about edge cases,\nabout why something was done a certain\nway in the first place. I remember one\nof our early customers wrote me a note\nwhen they retired because I was issuing\nthem at retirement and they had been\ninstrumental in taking the bet on us in\none of those special relationships and\nthey had said 50 years of working at\nthis company working with you was the\nfirst time someone who's brought in a\nproduct has ever felt like they\nunderstood us and to me that kind of\nindicates the strength of coming in as\nproduct person versus a salesoriented\nmind of being able to build trust and\nand build the depth of knowledge and\ndomain expertise that lends itself to a\ncustomer wanting to believe you can\nactually solve their problem versus make\npromises. Luckily for us, there was like\njust enough special people at a few\ncompanies who sort of saw some potential\nand spend the time and were willing to\nsort of help us build the initial\nkernel. It's somewhat luck and finding\nthe right person at the right time, it\nresonating on on that day and then that\nconversation going well and a lot\nhappens through that. Luckily, you don't\nneed that many of those experiences and\nrelationships at this point if you can\nreally develop some real core\nrelationships.\n>> And that company that told us we don't\nneed your services is now one of our\nlargest customers. Even though at the\nmoment it feels like this setback and\nyou're not sure of the viability of what\nyou're doing and whether it's even worth\npursuing anymore, if you just keep on\npersisting and actually getting more\ninformation, building up that bottoms up\nlike confidence of what you're working\non, it actually led us to persist past\nthat they ended up needing the services.\nMany people are thinking about AI in\nterms of like how can you use it to\nimprove existing workflows and this is\nespecially true in traditional\nindustries where like how can you now\nautomate something you couldn't\npreviously automate with the prior you\nknow generation of tools or how to\naugment humans by writing an email or\nnavigating a website. But I feel like\nthat's not actually the most interesting\nquestion. I think the real question is\nabout like what fundamental constraints\ncreated these workflows in the first\nplace and do those constraints actually\nlike still exist? If you think about any\nprior platform shift like web to mobile\nin the 2010s, the most successful\nproducts were actually rethinking what\nshould be on like a mobile app for\nexample, like Instagram for example, as\nopposed to a lot of the unsuccessful\nones just took a normal website and put\nit into a mobile app and it actually\nwasn't that compelling. It's because\nthere's actually like new things that\nare possible, right? You can like drag,\nyou can like multitask, etc. Now with\nthe AI platform shift, it's a similar\nsituation. In this context, it's all\nbased on this foundation of like really\nunderstanding what are like the\nfundamental problems that customers are\nfacing. When customers first come to us,\nwe'll map out their entire process. And\nit often looks like this like crazy\nflowchart with like 30 boxes all\ninterconnected. A big part of what we do\nis look at that and say, \"Hey, you can\nactually simplify this to three or four\nsteps, especially with what software and\nAI can do. And this is how our product\ncan actually do that.\" And that uh step\nof actually simplification rather than\njust trying to fit the crazy complexity\ninto a product is what actually lets us\nable to rethink and reimagine what's\nwhat's possible. That's the difference\nbetween optimizing what exists today\nversus like reimagining an entire\nfunction from scratch. The latter is a\ncompletely different opportunity that I\nthink will the winners of that\ntransition will have in common.\n>> A few years ago when we started the\ncompany building software for vertical\nindustries like automating work in them\nwas not that popular. It was a pretty\nunconventional thing to go into\nsomething like the insurance industry's\noutsiders and try to understand and\nautomate a lot of the work that's\nhappening there. But now it's super hot.\nSo like 70% of the most recent YC batch\nis now doing AI agents for X industry. I\nthink a big part of that is just because\nwhere AI is having the most impact right\nnow are these places that have been\npretty untouched by software\nhistorically. I think the biggest advice\nI have is like look where others don't\nwant to look. There's so many reasons\nthat folks will give you to like not\nexplore a space. And frankly, if we had\ntried to raise our seed round, not doing\nany discovery or validation before, we\nwould have never done this because\neveryone told us it was a bad idea. But\ngoing out on the field and sort of doing\nwhat folks have told you is not a good\nplace to play in. Sometimes that's where\nthe opportunity is. And I really think\nit's important to like go on a personal\nmission to find the truth because you\nnever really know their altitude and\nunderstanding of a problem until you\ndive in and try to figure it out\nyourself. So what has me really excited\nabout the future is there's still\nhundreds of billions of dollars spent on\nmanual work every year in this space and\nAI has opened that up into a massive\nopportunity and we're right at the\nforefront of being able to take\nadvantage of that\n>> and that means that to me this is very\nobviously one of the largest\nopportunities and you think about the\nnext 10 and 20 years in software that's\nsuper exciting for our\n[Music]", "language": "en", "title": "How to Find $10M+ Ideas in Markets We’d Never Worked In | Comulate, Jordan Katz & Michael Mattheakis"}
