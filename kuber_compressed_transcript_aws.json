  "transcript": "Um, I've been working in the cloud industry for over 10 years now. Um, I have been hopping between Microsoft and Google a few times. In each hop, I have been chasing something new. 3 years ago, I rejoined Azure to lead the managed coordinated service effort. Uh, uh, since then, I have been very lucky to work closely with Brendan Burns, Gabe Monreal, and many other cloud native folks in this area. And today, I'm going to focus on, uh, sharing the challenges uh we have experienced uh in the past and we are still experiencing in managing large number of clusters in the cloud. So here's the difference, it's not about the managing large clusters, but large number of clusters. Large cluster is a challenge itself. Uh, I can leave it to the future talk. But today, I'm gonna focus on how to manage large number of clusters with efficiency. Whenever people think about Kubernetes, the first thing that comes to their mind is, isn't Kubernetes supposed to make things easier? It is a cloud native and it's supposed to help the cloud native workload, right? But things are not that simple. First of all, we are serving the managed cluster to all Azure users. That means they can bring in a diverse requirements and a wider spectrum of workload onto the cluster. Then, as Kubernetes is born cloud native, It does bring new challenges to the cloud providers. In the past, the cloud providers are more facing more relatively static workload, and now Kuberne is making it much more dynamic. Then Kubernetes is successful because it's flexible and extensible, such as through CRDs and controllers. However, this flexibility and extensibility can bring in complexity, especially for the managers managing these clusters. Last but not least, the workload errors. These account for more than 50% of the tickets AKS receive. To help explain my talk today easier, let me first set a very simple example, a simple illustration of how AKS works. Uh, so you can understand the terminologies, uh, in the later part of my talk. So AKS is a multi-tenancy system. We host the customer control planes in a shared infrastructure that ATS owns, like we own. And then, when customer create a cluster, we first create the control plane onto our shared infrastructure. So, control plane include API servers, scheduler, controller managers, uh, uh, and ETCD. And then, we also created the workload, but these workloads are created in customers' subscriptions. And then, we join customers um nodes, um, which are the VMs, uh, we join, uh, in the future, they can be, um, they can be actual host or customer node. But for now, it's VMs in the, in Azure. And then we join these workload with into the, into the cluster. So first, let's talk about the diverse requirements. Ah, some examples, we serve customers in many industries. The bank industry, the customers are super sensitive about the security and compliance. They don't want anything exposed in the, into the internet, including their own control plan. So they require private clusters. And then, for gaming industry, they are exactly the opposite. They want, they even want the public IP per their workload. So they can max out, they can have maximum number of SNET port for their customers to connect to. And then there are customers who want, um, Who, who want the planned maintenance window. Meaning that they do not want any change happen to their cluster during this time, such as Walmart during the Black Friday time, as you can imagine. But there are also customers who are saying, well, I have so many clusters to manage. I just don't wanna manage each of them when it's time to upgrade. Please go ahead and do auto upgrade for them in case there is a CBE there's, you have new patches for bug fixes or security vulnerability fixes. Go ahead, auto-upgrade whenever you can. So things like that, as you can see, pose a pose a big challenge for our test. We have exploded test matrix to verify, and it's just simply not feasible and possible for a small team to handle all of them. So, we have to rely, we have to rely on production to some extent. But that can lead to outages. A very recent example is we switched from NTP to crony, um, but we, by mistake, we have to pull down the image at the node provision time from Ubuntu. And this broke some of the customers who blocked the Ubuntu uh URL for pulling down images. Uh, that's one of the IPY listing feature and unfortunately, we broke that, um, but we quickly detected and reverted. Next, Kubernetes brought new challenges to cloud providers. Why? So before Kuber natives, customers deploy workload into VM in a relatively static manner, meaning that, oh I'm gonna run these uh processes on these these VMs and it's predetermined. However, in Kubernetes, these are all dynamic. Thanks to the scheduler, um, Kubernetes achieve higher beam packing and Kubernetes can dynamically schedule and move workload, which is pod, uh, from VM to VM. Port workload become ephemeral. However, this can bring down the whole cluster. For example, a rogue, a rogue pod can bring the whole cluster down by killing the node, killing the VM one by one. And later in my demo, I will show you how that could happen. Then, with auto-scaling, with all sorts of auto-scaling and auto-remediation functionalities, Kubernetis is also constantly calling the control plane operations against the cloud providers. And usually, in the past, the cloud provider might not design their control plane um As scalable as their data plan. However, this makes their control plane, this pushes the car providers have to scale up their control plane to deal with the frequent, frequent poning and the frequent changes. Flexibility and extensibility. So, in running the managed coordinated service, we use a lot of open-source component, which is very nice because we don't have to develop them one by one. However, bugs in open-source softwares can be costly to fix. Here is an example. There is, you can say a bug or debate on resolve the behavior in Ubuntu since 18.04. It's a changed behavior. So customers were surprised, including us. We were surprised and it didn't work well for our customers. However, this bug has been there for 2 years and right now, it's still the, the authors and, and, and, and the audience are still debating about the fix or the behavior. Even worse, because of this, we have to turn off resolve D. But when we turn off resolve D, we didn't notice that some of the DNS resolution will take longer than before. And because of that, uh, we hit the timeout issue when we create a new cluster. Then, customers can add components because of the flexibility, because customer demand that, or, um, Because we are not fast enough to add these features. So we give these knobs for customer to turn. But when we give these knob to customer to turn, their components or their configurations could interfere with managed ones and deteriorate the managed experience. Here are a few examples. The scheduler. Kubernetes allow you to write a scheduler extensions to change how scheduling behave. But customer could write, ah, write nonperformant or incorrect scheduling logic, uh, which can make it harder for our engineers to debug when we get the ticket. webhooks. There's admission webhook and uh mutating web hook. And if customers change these webhook to decide how their workload are deployed, it could also be expensive and uh tricky for our engineers to understand why this pod is not deployed as expected. Another example is the DNS behavior. Um, customer, we allow customer to have customer DNS server or their configuration, but if they configure incorrectly or if their DNS server is behaving incorrectly, that can result into DNS resolution errors. Pot disruption budget, that's another example. This is actually very tricky and had cost AKS a lot of time of debugging. This interfere with upgrade, especially. So during upgrade, AKS is trying to do it one node by one node, but to do that, we need to coordin and drain an existing node and push the workload into other nodes. If a customer didn't set the port disruption budget correctly, that could get the node stuck forever without being able to drain. And because of that, our upgrade will fail. And, last but not least, as I mentioned, CRDs and controllers is a great way to expand, uh, coordinate capability. But they could also, for instance, they could also Uh, jeopardize, they could also result into incorrect behavior of the cluster. For instance, I mentioned earlier, uh, they called the DDoS, the API server, have so much request, all of them can be watching, uh, the API server simultaneously and leading to API server to go out of memory, uh, or, um, out of the in-flight request quota. Workload errors are probably more than 50% of the ticket we received by the AKS support engineers. Most common one is resource overcommit. Uh, in the demo later, I'm gonna show, I'm actually gonna illustrate how, uh, how easy a customer can, uh, shoot them in, in their own foot, um, by overcommit the workload into the system without knowing. Misconfiguration, as I mentioned quickly earlier, for instance, the coordinate and these places, uh, or their web cles or, or scheduled extension, they could have bug in the code or misconfiguration. um. Um, to make their cluster not working. Another example is the IAS resource such as the firewall rules or network uh security rules. If they configure incorrectly, if they happen to block the cluster to uh block their VM to access their, uh, API server URL, their cluster will not be able to function. Policy is another common problem we noticed. And the difference between configuration policy is configuration, for configuration, the cluster Amin usually themselves know what they did. But for policies, they didn't even know, they might not even know because usually policies are configured by the subscription admin or security admin that is out of their organization. But these policies, if configured incorrectly, can also result into, um, let's say, blocking uh egress or blocking ingress, which makes the cluster stop functioning. Of course, unexpected load, um, if the Uh, customer only test their application on a test environment, uh, without sufficient low test when they push this to production, uh, it could just get unexpected results such as, uh, cleaning their API server out of memory, uh, or, um, killing their coordinates pod and resulting to unexpected errors in their application, or, uh, even suffer like SNET port exhaustion is another common errors we have seen, um, in customers' production work uh workload. Now, how to manage these um challenges without growing the team size proportionally? Here are a few. Um, first, uh, we try to build the guardrails, build the guidelines to help customer fall into the pit of success instead of pit of failure. Then we also enhance observability, meaning that we are gonna share more of the metrics, more of the logging events, data to customer, and also, out of all these uh metrics and logging and all the signals, trying to, ah, pick out the signals that's most relevant to them, that they can take action on. Um, we also do quite some, uh, we also, we, we also start to do some work in the more managed and opinionated experience. Um, this is similar to, uh, GKE autopilot. In fact, we have the work, uh, going on for some time. But we are debating on this fully managed experience, or more flexibility left to the customer. Um, but based on the, uh, challenges and issues I mentioned in earlier slides, uh, we are going to go into more managed experience as well. Here's a few more things. Um, how do we help customer fall into the pit of success. First, we'll have documentation, at least start with documentation of best practice so they can follow. Then we also have the VS code extension, particularly to uh for AKS for customer to, for developers to interact with clusters from their IDE and also to get the logs, metrics, and the events from the cluster from their IDE. So, they, they have one place to do both development and production um debugging. Now, we also have proactive detection. Um, this is, uh, I mentioned earlier, the detectors and remediators so that we can detect if the customer's workload and the load is having problem or their workload is having problem or the configuration is having problem, and we're gonna show them in the AKS diagnostic portal later in my demo. Then, we also provide more guardrails, such as policies or webhooks and to reject unqualified or bad workload in advance before this workload even get into the cluster. Next, I'm gonna show you a quick demo to demonstrate what I mentioned earlier about the AKS diagnostics to help customer debug their production issues quickly. So here, uh, I prepared the demo first. I prepared a pod which is called the, you know, this is Kuberti shell demo. Um, and then, I'm gonna run some stress tests in the pod to show you what the customers themselves usually can do on the cluster to debug. So first, I'm gonna launch the uh stress test to do a lot of IO right uh against the, against the node. And here, as you can see, I launched a lot of uh the, the process to uh write against the, write against the OS disk and uh the load has picked up. The load has picked up and uh let's see what does the IO look like. I was that. OK. So, here, um, the right bytes, uh, we have get to about 42, but actually, uh, we have get to 42 megabytes per second, uh, write rate against the disk and during my short um Period of testing. And here, if you, uh, if I launch it again, you can see that the pickup. So, this is what the engineers uh themselves do. On the Did I pause it? Yeah. So here it gets to over 100 megabytes. Uh, the reason it's uh 100 megabytes is the VM type. I created the maximum, uh, the VM type and also the OS disk I picked. The maximum, um, uh, right, right throughput is uh 100 megabytes per second. And um I can also show you here on the Azure portal, uh, this is also picked up here. I have created a custom dashboard in advance to capture the disk write speed. As you can see during my test, um, the, uh, the, the As the metrics, ah, pick up in real, in almost real time. And the number of operations. So, here, we provide the customer two ways. One way is, uh, in the cluster, we can examine what's going on and uh which process is generating the load. Then, on the Azure portal, we are also showing user the, the single pane of glass across their VMs across their clusters, how it is doing. Next, I'm gonna uh launch another loader test that's gonna Make the node go out of memory. From this demo, I want to show two things. One is if you do not set the request and the limit on the port on the containers, when you create them, you could get the node killed. Because the pod itself can use up all the memory on the node and then get the node into non-schedulable state. That's where I earlier I mentioned that a rogue pod could kill your whole cluster because you can kill the node one by one. Here we go. We have seen that the pod has exit with the status score 137, and if we take a look and the pod Um, uh, the status is, uh, evicted. As expected, um, because this is the way that Kubernetis is, uh, protect, protecting itself, uh, itself. And here, you can see in the error code, um, in the event that it, uh, it, it got stopped because the node was low on memory. Now, this is how you can debug on the cluster, but for engineers who are managing 10s or 100s or even thousands of clusters, to do that one by one is not feasible. So, AKS provide this single pane of glass for engineers to come and exam um at a glance of what's going on in their cluster. Here, you can see we are showing 3 alerts. The first alert At the bottom here is the resource limit, not set. This is what I mentioned earlier. The uh Xiao demo pod I deployed didn't set the request and limit. Because of that, when the container is using too much memory in the pod, it result the whole node to be low in memory and result into some system pod got evicted as well.",
